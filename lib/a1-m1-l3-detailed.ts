  explanation: `We use different patterns to talk about where we are from:

Pattern 1: I'm from + Country

• I'm Spanish.

• Country ending in consonant → add -an or -ian
  Mexico → Mexican, Brazil → Brazilian
• Country ending in -a → change to -an
  China → Chinese (exception!)
• Some are irregular
  Spain → Spanish, France → French

Note: Nationalities are ALWAYS capitalized in English!`,
