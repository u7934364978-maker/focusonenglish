  grammarPoint: 'Talking about Age',
  explanation: `To ask and answer about age:

Question: How old are you?
Answer: I\'m [number] years old.
        I\'m [number]. (informal)

Examples:
• How old are you? - I\'m 25 years old.
• How old is she? - She\'s 30.
• How old are they? - They\'re both 18 years old.

Short forms:
• I\'m 20. = I\'m 20 years old.
• He\'s 35. = He\'s 35 years old.

Note: We use "years old" but we can omit it in informal conversation.
We NEVER say "I have 25 years" in English (this is a common mistake for Spanish speakers).`,
  examples: [
    'I\'m 28 years old.',

  text: `A Family Birthday Party

Today is a special day in our family. It\'s my grandmother\'s birthday! She\'s 75 years old today. We\'re having a big party at her house.

My grandmother\'s name is Rosa. She\'s very happy because all her family is here. My grandfather, Luis, is 78 years old. They\'re married for 50 years!

My mother is 45 years old and my father is 47. They have three children. I\'m the oldest. I\'m 20 years old and I\'m a university student. My brother, Carlos, is 17. He\'s in high school. My little sister, Emma, is only 12 years old. She\'s in middle school.

My aunt Patricia is 40 years old. She has two children. My cousin Miguel is 15 and my cousin Sofia is 10 years old. They\'re very nice kids.

At the party, there\'s a beautiful cake with 75 candles! It\'s too many candles, so we only put 7 candles plus 5 candles to represent 75. Everyone sings "Happy Birthday" to my grandmother. She\'s very emotional and happy.

My grandmother says, "Age is just a number. I feel young in my heart!" We all laugh and agree. It\'s a wonderful family celebration.`,
