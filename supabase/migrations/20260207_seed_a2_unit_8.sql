It's a great way to begin the week. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I often go to the library after work to read. I love reading mystery novels. Wednesdays are a bit different because I usually have dinner with my parents. I never miss it because family time is important to me. On Fridays, I sometimes meet my friends for a movie night. We don't always watch new movies, but it's fun to relax together. Saturdays are my cleaning days. I clean my house and do laundry. I don't like cleaning, but I have to do it. Finally, Sundays are for rest. I often relax at home and prepare for the new week. I rarely go out on Sundays. That's my week!
