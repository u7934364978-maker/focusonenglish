      "content": "Modern payments are often 'frictionless,' meaning they are fast and easy. You don't always need a physical card anymore.\n\n- **Contactless**: A payment method where you tap your card or device near a reader using NFC technology.\n- **NFC (Near Field Communication)**: The technology that allows devices to communicate wirelessly over short distances.\n- **Digital Wallet**: An app (like Apple Pay or Google Pay) that stores your credit card information securely on your phone.\n- **Wearable Tech**: Devices like smartwatches or rings that you can use to make payments.\n- **Tokenization**: A security process that replaces your sensitive card details with a unique 'token' to prevent fraud.\n- **Skimming**: An illegal practice where criminals use a device to steal information from the magnetic stripe of a card.\n- **Authentication**: The process of proving your identity, often using a fingerprint or face scan on your phone."
