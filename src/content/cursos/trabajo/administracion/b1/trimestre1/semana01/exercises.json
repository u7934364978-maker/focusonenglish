      "title": "Commercial vs. Investment Banking",
      "text": "The banking industry is primarily divided into two main sectors: commercial banking and investment banking. Commercial banks focus on individual consumers and small to medium-sized businesses. Their primary functions include accepting deposits, providing checking and savings accounts, and issuing loans such as mortgages and personal credit. These institutions earn profit mainly through the 'spread'—the difference between the interest they pay to depositors and the interest they charge to borrowers.\n\nIn contrast, investment banks deal with large corporations, institutional investors, and governments. Instead of taking deposits, they facilitate complex financial transactions. Their core services include underwriting new stock and bond issues, managing mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and providing financial advisory services. Investment bankers are often involved in high-stakes deal-making that requires deep market analysis and strategic planning. While commercial banking is highly regulated and generally considered stable, investment banking tends to be more volatile but offers higher potential returns during periods of economic growth.",
