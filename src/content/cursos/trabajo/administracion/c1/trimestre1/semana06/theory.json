  "title": "Week 6: WACC & Cost of Capital",
  "content": "# The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nWACC is the discount rate used in a DCF analysis to value a company. It represents the average rate a company is expected to pay to all its security holders to finance its assets.\n\n## The WACC Components\n1. **Cost of Equity (Re)**: Usually calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).\n2. **Cost of Debt (Rd)**: The interest rate the company pays on its debt, adjusted for the tax shield.\n3. **Capital Structure**: The proportion of debt and equity used by the company.\n\n### The Formula\n`WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1 - Tax Rate))`\n- E = Market value of equity\n- D = Market value of debt\n- V = Total value (E + D)\n\n## CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)\n`Re = Rf + Beta * (Rm - Rf)`\n- **Rf**: Risk-Free Rate (e.g., 10-year Treasury bond yield).\n- **Beta**: Measures the stock's sensitivity to market movements.\n- **Rm - Rf**: Equity Risk Premium (ERP).\n\n## Grammar: Hedging to Express Caution\nValuation is not an exact science. Use hedging to manage expectations:\n- *The WACC assumption appears to be somewhat aggressive.*\n- *It would seem that the Beta selection is slightly skewed.*\n- *Presumably, the risk-free rate will remain stable.*",
