A stakeholder is any individual or group who has an interest in or is affected by a project. Effective administration requires identifying these people early and managing their expectations through stakeholder mapping. By categorising stakeholders based on their power and interest, you can determine whether to manage them closely, keep them satisfied, or simply keep them informed, ensuring that everyone's needs are balanced.

Networking is the process of developing and maintaining professional relationships, often characterized by a blend of politeness and small talk. Mastering the art of reaching out, following up, and leveraging connections for mutual benefit is key to professional growth. You will also learn to craft an effective elevator pitch—a concise, persuasive summary of who you are and what you do—to make a lasting impression in any professional setting.

Relative clauses allow you to provide essential or extra information with precision, making your communication more sophisticated. Defining relative clauses provide essential details about stakeholders or reports, while non-defining relative clauses add extra information using commas. Mastering relative pronouns like 'who', 'which', 'whose', and the formal 'whom' ensures your writing is clear and avoids unnecessary repetition.

Professional networking requires specific phrasing to maintain a formal yet approachable tone. Whether you are reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration or following up with documents after a meeting, your language should reflect a goal of mutual benefit. Leveraging existing connections and using precise relative clauses helps you describe complex professional relationships and project details with confidence and accuracy.
