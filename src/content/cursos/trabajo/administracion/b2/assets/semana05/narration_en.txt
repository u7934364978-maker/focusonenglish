Leadership in administration is not necessarily about having a high-ranking title; it is about taking initiative, demonstrating accountability, and providing exceptional support. This week, we focus on leadership and team support. We will explore how to anticipate the needs of your department and master the art of 'managing up' to ensure total alignment with senior management.

Managing up involves consciously working with your manager to achieve the best results for everyone. This requires clarifying expectations, providing solutions rather than just highlighting problems, and adapting your communication style to fit their preferences. By taking ownership of your processes, you become a trusted partner who can oversee projects and ensure everything runs smoothly.

In your role, you will often need to arrange for tasks to be completed by others. This is where causative forms are essential. Whether you need to 'have the contracts signed' by Friday or 'get IT to fix' a persistent issue, these structures allow you to describe delegation and service management with precision. Understanding how to get someone to do something is a key skill for any coordinator.

Effective delegation also involves empowering others and setting a positive example. Mastering terms like 'briefing,' 'following through,' and 'managing expectations' will help you communicate with authority. Leadership in the support function often means taking the lead on specific initiatives while keeping everyone looped in to maintain transparency and momentum.

Your deliverable this week is a Leadership Reflection and Delegation Plan. You will reflect on a time you took the initiative and describe the outcome using causative forms. You will also create a plan for delegating specific tasks, specifying who you would get to do them. This exercise will help you articulate your value as a proactive and responsible administrative professional.
