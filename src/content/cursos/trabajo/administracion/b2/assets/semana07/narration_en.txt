In a high-pressure administrative environment, disagreements are inevitable. At a B2 level, the focus shifts from avoiding conflict to managing it diplomatically using objective language. We will explore strategies such as mediation, grievance handling, and consensus building. By using the 'I' statement technique, you can remain professional and non-accusatory, expressing concerns in a way that highlights their impact on the team's workflow rather than blaming individuals.

Giving feedback is a core administrative and leadership skill. Effective feedback should be 'Actionable, Specific, and Kind'. We will examine frameworks like Radical Candor, which involves challenging directly while caring personally. In a formal performance review, using professional phrasing such as 'one area for development is...' or 'moving forward, it would be beneficial to...' helps ensure that criticism is perceived as constructive rather than personal.

Mixed conditionals are invaluable for analyzing how past decisions impact current office conflicts. They allow us to link a hypothetical past with a present result, such as explaining how addressing an issue earlier would have prevented a current stalemate. Alternatively, they can link a present condition to a past result, showing how a person's character might have influenced their past actions. These structures demonstrate a deep understanding of cause and effect, which is essential for professional reporting.

To effectively manage mediation, you must master specific vocabulary. This includes knowing how to de-escalate tension, reach a consensus, and seek common ground when parties meet halfway. Understanding friction within a team and ensuring everyone takes accountability for their actions is vital for maintaining a productive workplace. These terms provide the linguistic tools necessary to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics with precision and authority.
