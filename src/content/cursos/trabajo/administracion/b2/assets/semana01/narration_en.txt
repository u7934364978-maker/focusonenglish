Welcome to your first week in the Operations team. At a B2 level, professional communication focuses on clarity, efficiency, and adhering to established protocols. In this session, we will explore standard operational roles, onboarding processes, and how to navigate internal communications in a neutral, factual tone.

Effective internal communication starts with understanding the 'ways of working'. We use a centralized Ops Inbox for external requests and track our progress on the Ops Board. Remember that time-sensitivity is critical; high-priority tasks must be flagged as urgent with a clear deadline to ensure they receive immediate attention.

Escalation is a professional tool, not a complaint. It should be used when a customer commitment is at risk, a dependency is blocked, or a formal decision is needed from another department. Mastering the escalation process allows you to maintain momentum and resolve issues before they impact the business.

When escalating, always use the standard checklist. State the objective facts, explain the impact on the business or stakeholders, and specify the deadline. You should also mention what actions you have already taken and clearly state what you need from management, such as a decision or a specific resource.

To complete this week, you must submit three items for your portfolio: a professional introductory email to the team, a one-page escalation document using the provided template, and a recording of your role-play session. Focus on maintaining a diplomatic register and using the thirty essential operational chunks we discussed.
