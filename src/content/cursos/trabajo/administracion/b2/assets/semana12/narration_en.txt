This week, we review the core competencies covered during the first trimester, from operational onboarding to risk management. You have developed the vocabulary and grammatical precision required for B2-level administration across operations, people management, project management, and risk analysis. This consolidation phase is crucial for ensuring you can apply these skills fluently in a professional environment.

Your final task is to draft a project proposal for an administrative improvement. A professional proposal should include an executive summary, an analysis of the current situation including any bottlenecks, and a description of the proposed solution and deliverables. You will also incorporate stakeholder analysis, risk assessment, and a clear timeline, demonstrating your ability to synthesize everything you have learned.

We will also conduct a comprehensive synthesis of the grammar used throughout the term. This includes mastering mixed and third conditionals for analyzing actions and results, as well as future tenses for discussing ongoing activities and deadlines. We will also refine our use of modals for deduction and relative clauses for precision, ensuring your professional communication is both accurate and sophisticated.

Reflection is a key part of the closure phase of any learning process. As you prepare your final project proposal, consider which areas of administration you feel most confident in and which require further practice. Evaluating your professional growth and identifying how to apply these skills in your future career marks the successful completion of this trimester's administrative training.
