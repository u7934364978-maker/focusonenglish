      "sampleAnswer": "Subject: Notification of potential data breach - [Date]\n\nDear DPO,\n\nI am writing to report a security incident involving the accidental disclosure of customer data. \n\nEarlier today, it was discovered that a spreadsheet containing approximately 200 customer email addresses was sent to an external vendor as part of a routine request. It is believed that this occurred due to an error in the file attachment process. \n\nWe have already contacted the vendor to request the immediate deletion of the file, and they have confirmed receipt of this request. At this stage, it is thought that the risk to the individuals affected is low, as no financial data or passwords were included. \n\nI am available to provide further details as you assess whether formal notification to the regulator is required.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
