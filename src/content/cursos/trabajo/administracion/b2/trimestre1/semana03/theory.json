      "content": "As an administrative professional at a B2 level, you are often the 'gatekeeper' of sensitive information. Understanding the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is essential for maintaining compliance and avoiding heavy fines for your organisation.\n\n### Core Principles\n- **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: Data must be processed legally and the subject must be informed.\n- **Purpose Limitation**: You should only collect data for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes.\n- **Data Minimisation**: Only collect the data that is absolutely necessary (e.g., don't ask for a passport number if only a name is needed).\n- **Storage Limitation**: Data should not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.\n- **Integrity and Confidentiality**: Ensuring protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss.\n\n### Subject Access Requests (SARs)\nA **Subject Access Request** is when an individual asks for a copy of the personal data an organisation holds about them. Administrative staff are often responsible for collating this data within the legal timeframe (usually 30 days)."

      "content": "A **data breach** occurs when personal data is lost, destroyed, corrupted, or disclosed without authority. \n\n**Action Protocol:**\n1. **Identify**: Confirm that a breach has occurred (e.g., an email sent to the wrong recipient).\n2. **Contain**: Take immediate steps to limit the damage (e.g., recall the email or lock the affected account).\n3. **Assess**: Determine the risk to the individuals affected.\n4. **Notify**: Under GDPR, serious breaches must be reported to the regulator within **72 hours**.\n\nIn professional communication, reporting a breach requires a factual, neutral tone without emotive language."

      "content": "In formal administration and legal contexts, we use **complex passive structures** to report information or opinions without attributing them to a specific person. This creates a sense of objectivity and distance.\n\n### Common Structures\n1. **It + is + [thought/said/believed/reported] + that...**\n   - *\"**It is reported that** the data breach was caused by a phishing attempt.\"*\n   - *\"**It is estimated that** over 500 records were compromised.\"*\n\n2. **Subject + is + [thought/said/believed/reported] + to + [infinitive]**\n   - *\"The server **is believed to have been** vulnerable for several months.\"*\n   - *\"The new policy **is expected to improve** our compliance score.\"*\n\nThese structures are particularly useful when writing reports where the source of information is confidential or when discussing general consensus."
