      "content": "To gauge the true health of a business, analysts look beyond simple profit and loss. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide a more nuanced view of efficiency and value creation.\n\n### Profitability and Return Ratios\n- **EBITDA**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It is used to analyze a company's operating profitability without the impact of financing and accounting decisions.\n- **ROE (Return on Equity)**: Measures how effectively management is using a company’s assets to create profits.\n- **ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)**: A financial ratio that can help in understanding how well a company is generating profits from its capital as it is put to use.\n\n### Liquidity and Solvency Ratios\n- **Quick Ratio (Acid Test)**: Similar to the current ratio but excludes inventory, providing a more conservative view of a company's ability to meet short-term obligations.\n- **Interest Coverage Ratio**: Determines how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt."

      "content": "Performance management involves comparing actual results against expectations and adjusting future plans accordingly.\n\n### Variance Analysis\n- **Favorable Variance**: Occurs when actual revenue is higher than budgeted, or actual costs are lower.\n- **Adverse (Unfavorable) Variance**: Occurs when actual revenue is lower or costs are higher than planned.\n- **Price vs. Volume Variance**: Breaking down a total variance to see if it was caused by changes in price/cost or by the quantity sold/used.\n\n### Rolling Forecasts\nUnlike a static annual budget, a **Rolling Forecast** is updated regularly (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to reflect the current economic reality. This allow businesses to be more agile in their decision-making."

      "content": "A dashboard synthesizes complex data into visual stories. For finance professionals, clarity is more important than decoration.\n\n### Design Principles\n- **Data-to-Ink Ratio**: Maximize the amount of data shown with the minimum amount of 'ink' (avoid unnecessary borders, 3D effects, or 'chart junk').\n- **Real-Time Integration**: Modern dashboards link directly to ERP systems to provide up-to-the-minute data.\n- **Drill-Down Capability**: The ability to click on a high-level metric to see the underlying data transactions."

Let's re-calculate.\"*\n- **Might / Could / May be**: 30-50% certain. *\"The increase in COGS **might be** due to the recent tariff hikes.\"*\n\n### Past Deduction (Modal + have + Past Participle)\n- **Must have been**: *\"Profits surged in Q3; the new marketing campaign **must have been** a success.\"*\n- **Could have been**: *\"The budget variance **could have been** caused by the unexpected strike at the port.\"*\n- **Can't have been**: *\"They **can't have known** about the acquisition, or the stock price would have moved earlier.\"*"
