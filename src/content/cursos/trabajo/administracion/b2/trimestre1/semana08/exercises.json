      "text": "Doc A — Internal Announcement: Transition to Paperless Office\n\nDear Team,\n\nWe are excited to announce a strategic **pivot** in our administrative operations. Starting next month, we will be transitioning to a fully paperless filing system. This move is designed to **streamline** our workflows and eliminate the frequent **bottlenecks** we've experienced with physical document retrieval. Replacing our **legacy systems** is a priority for this quarter.\n\nWe understand that some staff might have concerns about this transition. To ensure **buy-in** and address any initial **resistance**, we will be providing a series of workshops. We should have implemented this earlier, but we are confident that this **incremental** change will lead to a more **agile** office environment.\n\nUnder no circumstances will physical files be accepted after the 15th. We must have consulted the IT department properly, as the new server is already live and tested for **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**.\n\n**Highlighted Vocabulary:**\n- **Pivot**: A fundamental change in strategy or direction.\n- **Streamline**: To make a system or process more efficient.\n- **Bottlenecks**: Points in a process where the flow is restricted, causing delays.\n- **Legacy Systems**: Outdated computer systems or software applications.\n- **Buy-in**: Acceptance of and willingness to actively support a change.\n- **Resistance**: Refusal to accept or comply with something.\n- **Incremental**: Gradual or in small steps.\n- **Agile**: Characterized by quick movement and adaptability.\n- **UAT**: The final stage of testing before a system goes live.",
