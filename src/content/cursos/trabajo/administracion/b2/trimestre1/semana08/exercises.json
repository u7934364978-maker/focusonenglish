      "text": "Doc A — Internal Announcement: Transition to Paperless Office\n\nDear Team,\n\nWe are excited to announce a strategic pivot in our administrative operations. Starting next month, we will be transitioning to a fully paperless filing system. This move is designed to streamline our workflows and eliminate the frequent bottlenecks we've experienced with physical document retrieval.\n\nWe understand that some staff might have concerns about this transition. To ensure buy-in and address any initial resistance, we will be providing a series of workshops. We should have implemented this earlier, but we are confident that this incremental change will lead to a more agile office environment.\n\nUnder no circumstances will physical files be accepted after the 15th. We must have consulted the IT department properly, as the new server is already live and tested.",
