      "content": "Change management is the structured approach to transitioning individuals, teams, and organisations from a current state to a desired future state. In administration, this often involves new software, restructured workflows, or policy updates.\n\n### Key Concepts in Change\n- **Buy-in**: Obtaining agreement and support from stakeholders for a proposed change.\n- **Resistance to Change**: The natural emotional and behavioural reaction to perceived threats during a transition.\n- **To Streamline**: To make a system or process more efficient by removing unnecessary steps.\n- **To Pivot**: To change strategy or direction quickly in response to new information or market conditions.\n\n### Overcoming Resistance\nResistance often stems from a lack of communication. Administrators should focus on:\n1. **Transparency**: Explaining the 'why' behind the change.\n2. **Training**: Ensuring staff have the skills to handle new processes.\n3. **Incentivisation**: Highlighting the benefits for the employees themselves."

      "content": "When analyzing why a past change failed or succeeded, we use modal verbs for deduction. This allows us to speculate about past events with varying degrees of certainty.\n\n### Certainty (High)\n- **Must have + past participle**: We are almost certain something happened.\n  - *\"The implementation **must have failed** due to a lack of training.\"*\n- **Can't have + past participle**: We are almost certain something did NOT happen.\n  - *\"They **can't have tested** the software properly before the launch.\"*\n\n### Possibility (Medium to Low)\n- **Might / May / Could have + past participle**: We think it is possible, but we aren't sure.\n  - *\"The team **might have resisted** the change because they weren't consulted.\"*\n  - *\"A technical glitch **could have caused** the data loss during migration.\"*\n\n### Regret or Criticism\n- **Should have + past participle**: Something was a good idea but didn't happen.\n  - *\"We **should have communicated** the timeline more clearly.\"*"
