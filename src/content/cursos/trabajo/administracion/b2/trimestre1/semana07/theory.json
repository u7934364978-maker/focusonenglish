At a B2 level, the focus shifts from avoiding conflict to managing it diplomatically using objective language.\n\n### Conflict Resolution Strategies\n- **Mediation**: Intervening in a dispute to help parties reach a consensus. An administrator often acts as a neutral third party.\n- **Grievance Handling**: Following formal procedures when an employee raises a specific complaint about their treatment or working conditions.\n- **Consensus Building**: The process of reaching an agreement that all group members can support, even if it is not their first choice.\n\n### The 'I' Statement Technique\nTo remain professional and non-accusatory, use 'I' statements rather than 'You' statements:\n- **Instead of**: \"You always miss the deadline for the report.\"\n- **Use**: \"I feel concerned when the report is delayed because it impacts the entire team's workflow.\""
