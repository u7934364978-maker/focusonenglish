From operational onboarding to risk management, you have developed the vocabulary and grammatical precision required for B2-level administration.\n\n### Key Competencies Reviewed:\n- **Operations & Onboarding**: Understanding **Escalation** protocols, **SOPs** (Standard Operating Procedures), and **Asset Provisioning** for new hires.\n- **Conflict & Mediation**: Mastering **Rapport** building, **Empathy**, and the ability to **Meet Halfway** during internal disputes.\n- **Project Management**: Navigating the **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution**, and **Closure** phases, while monitoring **Scope Creep** and achieving **Milestones**.\n- **Risk & Continuity**: Utilizing the **Risk Matrix** to assess **Probability** and **Impact**, and implementing **BCP** (Business Continuity Planning) and **Disaster Recovery** strategies with defined **RTO** and **RPO** metrics."

      "content": "Your final task for this trimester is to draft a project proposal for an administrative improvement within a hypothetical or real organisation. A proposal must be **Persuasive**, **Logical**, and **Data-Driven**.\n\n### Proposal Structure:\n1. **Executive Summary**: A concise, high-level overview of the proposed change and its expected benefits.\n2. **Current Situation (The Bottleneck)**: Identifying the specific issue, delay, or inefficiency to be addressed.\n3. **Proposed Solution**: Describing the project, its **Deliverables**, and the **SOPs** that will change.\n4. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Mapping key players using the **Mendelow Matrix** and defining engagement strategies.\n5. **Risk Assessment**: Outlining potential risks, their probability/impact, and your **Mitigation** or **Contingency** plans.\n6. **Timeline & Milestones**: Stating key dates using future tenses to indicate commitments."

      "content": "Professional precision relies on the accurate use of complex structures to describe hypothetical scenarios and future plans.\n\n### 1. Conditionals for Analysis\n- **Third Conditional**: Used for 'lessons learned' in post-mortems. (*\"If we **had identified** the risk earlier, we **would have avoided** the delay.\"*)\n- **Mixed Conditionals**: Linking past actions (or lack thereof) to present states. (*\"If the company **had invested** in better servers last year, our systems **would be** more resilient now.\"*)\n\n### 2. Future Tenses for Planning\n- **Future Continuous**: For ongoing tasks during project execution. (*\"Next month, we **will be migrating** our data to the cloud.\"*)\n- **Future Perfect**: For definitive completions and deadlines. (*\"By the end of the quarter, we **will have trained** all staff on the new protocol.\"*)\n\n### 3. Modals and Relative Clauses\n- **Modals of Deduction**: Speculating about past incidents (*Must have*, *Can't have*, *Might have*).\n- **Relative Clauses**: Adding essential (Defining) or extra (Non-defining) information about stakeholders and projects. (*\"The Director, **who** is also a key player, has requested a full report.\"*)"
