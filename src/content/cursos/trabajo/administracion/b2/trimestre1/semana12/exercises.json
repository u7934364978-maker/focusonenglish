Investors no longer look solely at the bottom line; they demand that companies act with **stewardship** and transparency. This shift is also affecting **Trade Finance**, where blockchain technology is eliminating the need for paper **Bills of Lading**. However, these advances also bring new risks. As the **agency problem** persists, regulators must ensure that corporate **governance** structures remain robust. It is vital that we **embrace** these changes while maintaining the core principles of professional integrity.

We started with the bedrock of accounting—analyzing the **Balance Sheet** and **P&L**. We used the **DuPont Model** to see what really drives ROE. \n\nSpeaker 2: Then we moved into the complex world of global risk. We explored how banks use **VaR** and **stress testing** to survive the next 'black swan' event. We also looked at **Trade Finance**, where **Letters of Credit** bridge the trust gap between continents. \n\nHost: In the final weeks, we focused on integrity. We saw how **internal audit** functions as a shield, and how **ESG** is no longer optional. We discussed the **agency problem** and how robust **governance** is essential to prevent another Enron. \n\nSpeaker 2: And let's not forget the language. From **Mixed Conditionals** for analyzing past decisions to the **Subjunctive** for board recommendations, we've developed the tools to speak like a true finance leader. Good luck with the final assessment!",
