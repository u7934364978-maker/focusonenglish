If we had automated this last quarter, we wouldn't be facing the current backlog of approvals (Mixed Conditional).\n\nSolution: We propose to implement 'VetScan', a software tool that will be monitoring vendor compliance in real-time (Future Continuous). By the end of Q1, we will have integrated all existing vendor data into the new system (Future Perfect).\n\nRisk Assessment: The primary risk is staff resistance to the new workflow. Our mitigation strategy involves holding three training workshops. Under no circumstances should the legacy system be deactivated before the new data is fully reconciled.\n\nKPI: 50% reduction in approval time.",
