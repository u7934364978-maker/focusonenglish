      "text": "In the world of corporate finance, the **internal audit** team is often viewed as the final line of defense against fraud. However, what happens when the fraud is orchestrated by those at the top? This is the whistleblower's dilemma. Whistleblowers are individuals who expose secretive information or activity within an organization that is deemed illegal or unethical. \n\nRecent history is replete with examples where massive financial discrepancies **were found to have been hidden** for years through complex accounting tricks. These cases often involve a lack of **fiduciary duty**, where executives prioritize personal gain over the interests of shareholders. In many jurisdictions, laws like SOX provide protection for whistleblowers, yet the fear of **retaliation** remains a significant deterrent. It **is widely believed** that for every reported case of fraud, several others go undetected due to a corporate culture of silence. Furthermore, the **materiality** of certain small but recurring errors can be overlooked by auditors, which, when aggregated over time, can lead to systemic collapse.",

For instance, the **revenue recognition** process is always a focus. It **is alleged** that some sales were recorded before the goods actually left the warehouse. \n\nJunior: That would be a material misstatement, right?\n\nSenior Auditor: Exactly. We also need to check the **segregation of duties**. If the same person who authorizes a payment also records it in the system, the **controls** are effectively useless. We'll be performimg a series of **substantive tests** on large invoices. If the paper trail **is found to have been tampered** with, we'll need to expand our scope significantly.
