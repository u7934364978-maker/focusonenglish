We have identified several key stakeholders whom we must manage closely.\n\nKey Stakeholders:\n1. Finance Director (High Power, High Interest): Mr. Davies, whose approval is required for all project expenses, will receive weekly updates.\n2. Client Success Team (Low Power, High Interest): These are the users who will use the portal daily. We will consult them during the testing phase.\n3. External Vendors (Low Power, Low Interest): They will be kept informed via the monthly newsletter.\n\nStrategy: We will leverage our existing relationship with the IT department to streamline the launch. It is essential that we reach out to the Finance Director before Friday to confirm the budget allocation.",
