Finance Director (High Power, High Interest): Mr. Davies, whose approval is required for all project expenses, will receive weekly updates.\n2. Client Success Team (Low Power, High Interest): These are the users who will use the portal daily. We will consult them during the testing phase.\n3. External Vendors (Low Power, Low Interest): They will be kept informed via the monthly newsletter.\n\nStrategy: We will leverage our existing relationship with the IT department to streamline the launch.
