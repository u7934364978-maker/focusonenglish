      "content": "In business administration, a **stakeholder** is defined as any individual, group, or organization that can affect or be affected by a project's outcome. To manage these relationships effectively, administrators use the **Mendelow Matrix**, which categorises stakeholders based on two variables: **Power** (their ability to influence the project) and **Interest** (how much they care about the project).\n\n### Mapping the Four Quadrants\n1.  **High Power, High Interest (Key Players)**: These stakeholders must be fully engaged. They require regular communication and often have decision-making authority. *Example: The Project Sponsor or major investors.*\n2.  **High Power, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)**: They have the power to block a project but don't care about the details. Administrators must keep them satisfied to avoid resistance. *Example: Government regulators or senior management from other departments.*\n3.  **Low Power, High Interest (Keep Informed)**: These people are affected by the project but have little power. They should be kept informed to ensure they remain supportive. *Example: Employees in the department being restructured.*\n4.  **Low Power, Low Interest (Monitor Only)**: These require minimum effort. Administrators should monitor them for changes in their power or interest levels.\n\n### Internal vs. External Stakeholders\n*   **Internal**: Employees, managers, and owners.\n*   **External**: Suppliers, customers, local communities, and government agencies."

      "title": "Professional Networking & UK Etiquette",
      "content": "**Networking** is the strategic process of building and maintaining professional relationships for mutual benefit. In the UK, networking is often built on the principle of **reciprocity**—the idea that you should offer value before asking for a favour.\n\n### The Elevator Pitch\nAn **Elevator Pitch** is a concise, 30 to 60-second summary of who you are, what you do, and what value you bring to the table. It is essential for networking events and initial introductions.\n\n### UK Cultural Nuances\n- **Small Talk**: British professionals often start with non-work topics (the weather, travel) to build rapport before discussing business.\n- **Indirectness**: Instead of saying \"I want a job,\" a professional might say, \"I'm interested in learning more about how your department operates.\"\n- **Follow-up Protocol**: It is standard practice to send a brief LinkedIn message or email within 24 hours of meeting a new contact to **reiterate** your interest in staying in touch."

      "content": "Relative clauses are essential for providing specific details about stakeholders and processes without creating repetitive sentences. \n\n### Defining Relative Clauses\nThese provide essential information. If removed, the sentence loses its core meaning. We do **not** use commas.\n- *\"The consultant **who** specialises in stakeholder mapping is arriving today.\"*\n- *\"The software **that** we use for CRM helps us track engagement.\"*\n- **Omission**: In defining clauses, you can omit *who/which/that* if it is the **object** of the clause. (*\"The contact [that] I met yesterday was very helpful.\"*)\n\n### Non-Defining Relative Clauses\nThese provide extra, non-essential information. We **must** use commas.\n- *\"Our CEO, **who** has over 20 years of experience, will lead the networking event.\"*\n- *\"The new project, **which** involves three different departments, will launch in March.\"*\n\n### Relative Pronouns & Adverbs\n- **Whose**: Shows possession. (*\"The manager **whose** department is affected should be consulted.\"*)\n- **Whom**: Used for people as an object, especially after prepositions. (*\"The stakeholder **to whom** we sent the report has responded.\"*)\n- **Where / When / Why**: Used for places, times, and reasons. (*\"The office **where** the meeting is held is on the 5th floor.\"*)"
