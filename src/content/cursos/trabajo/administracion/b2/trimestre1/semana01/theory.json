At a B2 level, professional communication focuses on clarity, efficiency, and adhering to established protocols.\n\n### Internal Communication: The Welcome Email\nWhen joining a new team, you must understand the 'ways of working' immediately. Key protocols often include:\n- **Ops Inbox**: Centralized channel for external team requests.\n- **Ops Board**: Visual tracking of tasks through statuses like *New*, *In Progress*, *Blocked*, and *Done*.\n- **Time-sensitivity**: High-priority tasks must be flagged as *Urgent* with a clear *deadline*.\n\n### Escalation Guidelines\nEscalation is not about complaining; it is a professional tool used when:\n1. A customer commitment is at risk.\n2. A dependency is blocked (you cannot progress without someone else's input).\n3. You need a formal decision from another department.\n\n**Escalation Checklist:**\n- **Facts**: What happened (objective data).\n- **Impact**: Who or what is affected.\n- **Deadline**: When do we need a solution?\n- **Tried**: What actions have you already taken?\n- **Need**: What specifically do you need (decision, resource, or confirmation)?"
