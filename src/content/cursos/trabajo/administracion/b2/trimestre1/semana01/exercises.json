Alex will support day-to-day coordination across teams and help us keep requests moving.\n\nWays of working (recap):\n1. Use the Ops Inbox for requests that can’t be solved within your team.\n2. If a request is time-sensitive, flag it as Urgent and include a deadline.\n3. We track work in the Ops Board (status: New / In progress / Blocked / Done).\n4. If something is blocked for more than 24 hours, please escalate in the daily check-in.\n\nThanks,\nPriya",
