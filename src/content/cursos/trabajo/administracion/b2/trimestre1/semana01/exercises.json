I had been working in marketing for my company in London for five years, and I felt like I needed a new challenge.\n\nInterviewer: What made you choose Singapore specifically?\n\nSarah: To be honest, I had never considered Asia before. But then I attended a conference where I met some colleagues from our Singapore office. They had been working there for a couple of years and couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was. By the time the conference ended, I had already decided that I wanted to explore opportunities there.\n\nInterviewer: And how did you find the transition?\n\nSarah: It was definitely challenging at first. I had prepared as much as I could – I had read about the culture, learned some basic phrases, and even visited once before moving. But still, nothing could have fully prepared me for the reality of living there. I had been living in London my entire life, so adapting to such a different culture was quite a shock initially.\n\nInterviewer: What was the biggest challenge?\n\nSarah: Probably the work culture. I had expected some differences, but I hadn't realized how much the business environment would differ from what I was used to. I had been accustomed to a very direct communication style in London, but in Singapore, people tend to be more indirect and diplomatic.\n\nInterviewer: And would you recommend the experience to others?\n\nSarah: Absolutely! By the end of my two-year contract, I had grown both personally and professionally in ways I never could have if I had stayed in London. I had made lifelong friends, learned about a completely different way of doing business, and gained a much broader perspective on the world.",
