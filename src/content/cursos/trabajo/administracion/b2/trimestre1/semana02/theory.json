In Operations, an effective handover prevents duplicated work, invisible blockers, late decisions, and missed deadlines (SLAs).\n\n### Core Principle\nHandover = **Clarity + Action**. If the receiver does not know what to do, who is doing it, and when it is due, the handover has failed."

ETR is 2pm. Next update at 12:30pm.'\n\n### Professional Tone during Crises\n- **Avoid**: 'I'm sorry, everything is a mess.'

Deliver a structured handover using the 7-block structure. Emphasize what is blocked and the current risks.\n- **Role B (Incoming Coordinator)**: Listen to the handover, ask clarifying questions about dependencies, and confirm the next steps and owners.\n\n### Evaluation Rubric\n- **Structure**: Adherence to the 7-block template.\n- **Clarity**: Use of signposting (*'The key point is...'*, *'Next steps are...'*) and precise timing (*'Friday EOD'*, *'COB'*).\n- **Factual Tone**: Focus on root causes and mitigation rather than blame.\n- **Risk Awareness**: Clear identification of potential schedule slips."
