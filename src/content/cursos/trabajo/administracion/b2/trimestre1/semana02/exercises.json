      "sampleAnswer": "Subject: Proposal to automate the weekly Ops Board update\n\nDear Sarah,\n\nI am writing to suggest a small improvement to our weekly workflow. Currently, we are manually updating the Ops Board, which is quite time-consuming and, frankly, error-prone during busy periods.\n\nI propose that we integrate our task tracker directly with the board using a simple automation script. By implementing this solution, we will be saving approximately three hours of manual entry per week. \n\nI am confident that by the end of next month, we will have eliminated all manual data entry errors in this specific area. This will allow the team to focus on more high-value tasks.\n\nI would like to align on next steps for this project when you have a moment.\n\nKind regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
