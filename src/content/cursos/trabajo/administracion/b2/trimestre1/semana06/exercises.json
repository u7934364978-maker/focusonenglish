These must be left in the secure lockers provided at the entrance.\n\nRegarding transport, **not only is the facility in a remote location, but it also** requires a pre-cleared shuttle for access. Therefore, it is vital that everyone arrives at the designated meeting point by 07:30 sharp.\n\nFailure to comply with these protocols may result in a denial of entry. Thank you for your cooperation.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
