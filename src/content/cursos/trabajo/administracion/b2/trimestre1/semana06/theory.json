      "content": "At the B2 level, agenda management goes beyond just 'booking meetings'. It involves strategic time management and protecting the executive's most valuable resource: their time.\n\n### Strategic Calendar Management\n- **Time Blocking**: Dedicating specific hours for 'Deep Work' or email management to prevent the executive from being overwhelmed by meetings.\n- **Buffer Time**: Intentionally leaving 10–15 minutes between meetings to allow for overruns, travel between rooms, or a quick mental reset.\n- **Priority Alignment**: Reviewing the calendar against the executive's key goals to ensure they are spending time on high-impact activities.\n- **Gatekeeping**: Politely but firmly declining or redirecting meeting requests that do not require the executive's direct involvement."

This means cross-referencing meeting times with the executive's 'home' time zone to identify potential energy slumps."
