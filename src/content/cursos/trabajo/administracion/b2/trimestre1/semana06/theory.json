It estimates the maximum potential loss a portfolio could face over a specific time horizon with a given confidence level (e.g., 'There is a 95% probability that the bank will not lose more than $10 million in a single day')."

Regulators require major banks to undergo annual stress tests to ensure they have sufficient **Capital Buffers** to survive a systemic crisis."

Buying a 'Put Option' acts as insurance against a decline in a stock's price.\n- **Futures and Forwards**: Obligate the parties to transact an asset at a future date at a set price. Used extensively by airlines to hedge fuel costs and by farmers to lock in crop prices.\n- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: A type of insurance against the default of a borrower. The buyer of a CDS pays a periodic fee to the seller in exchange for a payout if a third party defaults."
