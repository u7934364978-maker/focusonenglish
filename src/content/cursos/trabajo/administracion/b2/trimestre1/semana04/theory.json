      "content": "Taking minutes is more than just recording what people say; it is about capturing the **decisions made** and the **actions assigned**. In a B2 professional context, your minutes should be concise, objective, and easy to scan.\n\n### Key Components of Minutes\n- **Header**: Name of the meeting, date, time, and location.\n- **Attendance**: List of those present and those who sent apologies (absent with a valid reason).\n- **Approval of Previous Minutes**: Confirming the last meeting's record was accurate.\n- **Main Discussion Points**: A summary of the key arguments (not a word-for-word transcript).\n- **Decisions**: Clear statements of what was agreed upon.\n- **Action Items**: Specific tasks assigned to individuals with deadlines.\n- **AOB (Any Other Business)**: Small items not on the original agenda.\n- **Next Meeting**: Date and time of the next session.\n\n### Tone and Style\nMinutes should always be written in the **past tense** and use **objective language**. Avoid emotive adjectives (e.g., instead of 'a heated discussion', use 'a detailed discussion')."

An **Action Item** must follow the **SMART** criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).\n\n**Common format:**\n- *\"**Action**: [Name] to [Task] by [Date]\"*\n- *\"**Action**: HR to circulate the new privacy policy by Friday 12th.\"*\n\nAs an administrator, you are often responsible for 'chasing' these actions. This requires a balance of persistence and professional politeness."

      "content": "When writing minutes or summaries, we rarely use 'said' or 'told'. Instead, we use **reporting verbs** that convey the intent of the speaker.\n\n### Reporting Verbs\n1. **Suggest / Recommend (+ -ing or + that)**:\n   - *\"The Chair **suggested moving** the deadline to October.\"*\n   - *\"The team **recommended that** we hire an external consultant.\"*\n\n2. **Urge (+ object + to + infinitive)**:\n   - *\"The CEO **urged the team to focus** on efficiency.\"*\n\n3. **Point out / State (+ that)**:\n   - *\"Finance **pointed out that** the budget was already exceeded.\"*\n\n4. **Agree / Refuse (+ to + infinitive)**:\n   - *\"Marketing **agreed to provide** the assets by EOD.\"*\n\n### Tense Shift Reminder\nWhen reporting what was said in the past, the tenses usually shift back:\n- *\"I **am** working on it\"* → *\"He said he **was** working on it.\"*\n- *\"We **will** finish tomorrow\"* → *\"They said they **would** finish the following day.\"*"
