      "text": "The collapse of Enron in 2001 remains one of the most significant examples of **governance** failure in history. At its height, Enron was the seventh-largest company in the US, yet its success was a mirage. Through a complex web of 'Special Purpose Entities', the company managed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its **balance sheet**. This **creative accounting** allowed the company to maintain a high credit rating and keep its stock price soaring.\n\nThe failure was not just in the accounting, but in the oversight. The board of directors, including the audit committee, failed in their **fiduciary duty** to protect shareholders. Furthermore, Enron's external auditors were found to have a significant **conflict of interest**, as they were also receiving millions in consulting fees from the firm they were auditing. The scandal led to the dissolution of Arthur Andersen and the passage of the SOX Act. It is now imperative that every public company **maintain** a clear **segregation of duties** and that auditors **remain** strictly independent. If the board **had questioned** the complex transactions more aggressively, the largest bankruptcy in US history **might have been** avoided.",

      "transcript": "Interviewer: ESG is the buzzword of the decade. But how do we know companies are actually doing what they claim? \n\nExpert: That's the billion-dollar question. We're seeing a lot of **Greenwashing**, where firms spend more time and money on marketing themselves as environmentally friendly than on actually reducing their carbon footprint. \n\nInterviewer: So, what's the solution?\n\nExpert: Transparency. It is vital that regulators **standardize** ESG reporting. Right now, it's a 'Wild West' of different metrics. We also recommend that institutional investors **take** their **stewardship** role more seriously. They shouldn't just look at the 'E'; the 'G'—**Governance**—is what ensures the other pillars are actually being respected. \n\nInterviewer: Can **shareholder activism** help?\n\nExpert: Absolutely. We've seen activists insist that oil companies **disclose** their long-term climate risks. It's no longer just about profit; it's about the sustainability of the business model. If a company **does not adapt** to these new ethical standards, it **will eventually lose** its 'social license' to operate.",
