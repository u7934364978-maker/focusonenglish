      "content": "Risk management is the process of identifying, evaluating, and prioritising risks to minimise their impact on a project or organisation.\n\n### The Risk Matrix\nRisks are generally assessed based on two criteria:\n1. **Probability**: How likely is it that the risk will occur?\n2. **Impact**: How severe will the consequences be if it does occur?\n\n### Risk Response Strategies\n- **Avoidance**: Changing the project plan to eliminate the risk entirely.\n- **Mitigation**: Taking steps to reduce the probability or impact of a risk.\n- **Transfer**: Passing the risk to a third party (e.g., through insurance).\n- **Acceptance**: Acknowledging the risk and deciding not to take any action unless it occurs."

      "content": "It is important to distinguish between acting before a risk occurs and acting after it occurs.\n\n### Key Definitions\n- **Mitigation Plan**: Actions taken *before* a risk event occurs to reduce its likelihood or impact (e.g., installing a fire alarm).\n- **Contingency Plan**: A pre-defined set of actions to be taken *after* a risk event occurs (e.g., an evacuation plan).\n- **Disaster Recovery**: The process of restoring normal operations after a major disruptive event.\n- **Workaround**: An unplanned response to an unexpected problem."

In business, it is essential for 'post-mortem' meetings to analyze what could have been done differently.\n\n### Structure\n*If + Past Perfect, would have + past participle*\n\n### Examples\n- *\"If we **had implemented** the backup system, we **wouldn't have lost** the data.\"*\n  - (Fact: We didn't implement it, so we lost the data).\n- *\"If the supplier **had delivered** on time, the project **would have finished** according to the schedule.\"*\n  - (Fact: They didn't deliver on time, so it didn't finish on time).\n\n### Using 'Could have' or 'Might have'\n- *\"If we **had known** about the new regulations, we **could have adjusted** our strategy.\"* (Ability/Possibility).\n- *\"If the weather **had been** better, the outdoor event **might have been** more successful.\"* (Probability)."
