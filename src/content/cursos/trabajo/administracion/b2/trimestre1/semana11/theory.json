      "content": "Risk management involves a systematic approach to identifying and evaluating potential problems that could undermine a project's success. Administrators use a **Risk Matrix** (or 'Heat Map') to rank risks based on two dimensions:\n\n1.  **Probability**: The likelihood of the risk occurring (Scale of 1-5).\n2.  **Impact**: The severity of the consequences (Scale of 1-5).\n\n### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Analysis\n- **Qualitative**: Descriptive assessment (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low').\n- **Quantitative**: Numerical assessment, often involving financial costs or time delays.\n\n### Response Strategies\n- **Mitigation**: Proactive steps to reduce likelihood. (*e.g., Cross-training staff to prevent a single point of failure.*)\n- **Transfer**: Moving the risk to a third party. (*e.g., Outsourcing a complex technical task to specialists.*)\n- **Avoidance**: Eliminating the cause of the risk. (*e.g., Deciding not to enter a high-risk market.*)"

(*\"We managed to **head off** a major PR disaster.\"*)\n- **To back up**: To make a copy of data for security. (*\"Ensure you **back up** all project files every evening.\"*)\n- **To fall through**: To fail to happen (often regarding plans or deals). (*\"The deal **fell through** because we didn't have a contingency plan.\"*)\n- **To deal with**: To take action to solve a problem. (*\"The administrator has to **deal with** several compliance issues.\"*)\n- **To ward off**: To prevent an attack or danger. (*\"New security software was installed to **ward off** cyber-attacks.\"*)"
