I was particularly impressed by how you **anticipated our needs** by having the new furniture delivered on Friday evening, avoiding any disruption to the team on Monday morning.\n\nYou showed great **initiative** when you got the IT team to reconfigure the server room ahead of schedule. Your **accountability** when the floor tiling was delayed was also noted; rather than just flagging the issue, you proposed a solution to have the contractors work on Saturday morning to stay on track.\n\nYou have set an excellent example for the junior coordinators. Let’s touch base on Wednesday to discuss how we can empower you to **take the lead** on the Q4 budget planning.\n\nBest,\nSarah\n\n### Highlighted Vocabulary\n1. **Anticipating Needs**: Identifying what a manager needs before they ask for it (e.g., preparing a briefing pack before a meeting).\n2. **Initiative**: The ability to assess and initiate things independently.\n3. **Accountability**: Taking ownership of processes and being responsible for the outcome, whether positive or negative.\n4. **Take the lead**: To take the main responsibility for a task.",
