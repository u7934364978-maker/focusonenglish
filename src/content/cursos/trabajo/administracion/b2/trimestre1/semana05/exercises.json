I was particularly impressed by how you anticipated our needs by having the new furniture delivered on Friday evening, avoiding any disruption to the team on Monday morning.\n\nYou showed great initiative when you got the IT team to reconfigure the server room ahead of schedule. Your accountability when the floor tiling was delayed was also noted; rather than just flagging the issue, you proposed a solution to have the contractors work on Saturday morning to stay on track.\n\nYou have set an excellent example for the junior coordinators. Let’s touch base on Wednesday to discuss how we can empower you to take the lead on the Q4 budget planning.\n\nBest,\nSarah",
