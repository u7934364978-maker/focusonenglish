Large funds, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, now incorporate ESG scores into their fiduciary duty framework, arguing that companies with poor governance or high environmental risks are inherently riskier long-term investments.\n\nHowever, this rapid growth has led to accusations of 'greenwashing'—a practice where companies or funds provide misleading information about how their products are more environmentally sound than they actually are. To combat this, regulators like the SEC in the US and the ESMA in Europe are introducing stricter disclosure requirements. Analysts are now moving beyond broad ESG scores and performing deep-dive 'Impact Analysis' to verify that a 'Green Bond' is actually funding a sustainable project, rather than just refinancing existing corporate debt. For the professional asset manager, the challenge lies in balancing these non-financial metrics with the traditional goal of maximizing alpha.",

It looks like you've been trimming our exposure to US Mega-cap Tech.\n\nManager: Exactly. We've enjoyed a great run, but valuations are looking stretched. We've decided to 'trim' those positions—taking some profit—and we're 'tilting' the portfolio towards Value stocks and ESG-compliant Emerging Market funds. We believe these areas are currently undervalued.\n\nClient: And what about the fixed income side? Are we still overweight in government bonds?\n\nManager: We've actually moved to a 'neutral' weighting. With the recent inflation data, we expect yields to rise, which would hurt the price of long-term bonds. Instead, we've increased our allocation to 'Short-duration' Green Bonds. This protects us from interest rate risk while maintaining our ESG targets. By the end of the year, we will have transitioned about 25% of your total fixed-income allocation into these sustainable instruments.",
