          "content": "In asset management, returns are often categorized into two components:\n- **Beta**: The return attributed to the overall market movement. A beta of 1.0 means the asset moves in lockstep with the benchmark.\n- **Alpha**: The 'active' return on an investment that exceeds the market benchmark. Achieving alpha is the primary goal of active fund managers through superior security selection or market timing."

          "content": "Professional managers don't just look at raw returns; they evaluate risk-adjusted performance.\n- **Sharpe Ratio**: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation. Measures the excess return per unit of volatility. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.\n- **Information Ratio**: Measures the consistency with which a manager generates alpha relative to a benchmark.\n- **Efficient Frontier**: A concept from Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) representing the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk."

Often charge a '2 and 20' fee structure (2% management fee and 20% performance fee).\n- **Private Equity (PE)**: Direct investment into private companies or the buyout of public companies to take them private.\n- **Venture Capital (VC)**: A subset of PE focused on early-stage, high-growth startups."
