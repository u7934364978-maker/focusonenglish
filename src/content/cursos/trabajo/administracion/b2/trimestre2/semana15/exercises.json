If only we had invested in waterproof cabinets last year, this cost could have been avoided. However, the laptops were essential to maintain BAU for the support team.\n\nTo compensate for this overspend, we have identified an underspend in 'Office Events' which we propose to reallocate. Moving forward, I wish management would approve a small 'contingency fund' for such emergencies. We will also ensure all future equipment purchases are correctly logged as CAPEX rather than OPEX.",
