As a result, office connectivity is down.\n\nImmediate Actions:\n1. We have triggered our BCP (Business Continuity Plan).\n2. A manual workaround has been implemented for urgent client payments; please use the secure offline terminal in the Finance office.\n3. Staff are requested to switch to mobile hotspots or work from home if their tasks are not location-dependent.\n\nIt is expected that service will be restored by 6 PM tonight. We will conduct a full post-mortem on Monday to evaluate our response.\n\nThanks,\nOperational Support",
