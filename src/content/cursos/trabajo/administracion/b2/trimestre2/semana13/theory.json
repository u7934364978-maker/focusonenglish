Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is the process of creating systems of prevention and recovery to deal with potential threats.\n\n### The 3 Stages of Crisis Management:\n1. **Pre-crisis**: Identification of risks and creation of the BCP.\n2. **Crisis Response**: The immediate actions taken when the crisis occurs.\n3. **Post-crisis**: Evaluation of the response and updating the BCP.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The duration of time within which a business process must be restored.\n- **Workaround**: A temporary solution used when the standard process is unavailable.\n- **Disaster Recovery (DR)**: Specifically refers to the IT and data restoration side of business continuity."
