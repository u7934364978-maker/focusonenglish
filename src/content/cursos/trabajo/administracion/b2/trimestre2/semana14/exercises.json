Streamline the approval workflow using the new automated portal.\n2. Conduct a training session on 'Data Minimisation' for all admin staff by Friday EOD.\n3. Implement a 'Clean Desk' policy to adhere to ISO 9001 standards.\n\nRarely has the team been so responsive to feedback; we expect all issues to be resolved within the next sprint.",
