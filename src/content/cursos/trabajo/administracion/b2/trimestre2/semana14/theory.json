      "content": "Quality Management Systems (QMS) are formalized systems that document processes, procedures, and responsibilities for achieving quality policies and objectives. In administrative roles, this often aligns with ISO 9001 standards.\n\n### Core Principles of QMS:\n- **Customer Focus**: Meeting and exceeding customer expectations.\n- **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**: Always looking for ways to make processes more efficient.\n- **Evidence-based Decision Making**: Using data, not just intuition, to make changes.\n\n### The PDCA Cycle:\n1. **Plan**: Identify the problem and plan the improvement.\n2. **Do**: Implement the change on a small scale.\n3. **Check**: Use data to analyze the results.\n4. **Act**: If successful, implement the change on a wider scale."

      "content": "Inversion (reversing the subject and the auxiliary verb) is used in formal writing and presentations to emphasize a point. It usually follows a negative or restrictive adverb.\n\n### Common Structures:\n- **Never/Seldom/Rarely**: *Never have we seen such high efficiency.*\n- **Not only... but also**: *Not only did we reduce waste, but we also improved speed.*\n- **Under no circumstances**: *Under no circumstances should the audit files be left open.*\n- **Only then**: *Only then did we realize the process was broken.*\n- **At no time**: *At no time was the customer data at risk.*"
