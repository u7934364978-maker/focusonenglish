      "content": "Quality Management Systems (QMS) are formalized systems that document processes, procedures, and responsibilities for achieving quality policies and objectives. In administrative roles, this often aligns with ISO 9001 standards.\n\n### Core Principles of QMS:\n- **Customer Focus**: Meeting and exceeding customer expectations.\n- **Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**: Always looking for ways to make processes more efficient.\n- **Evidence-based Decision Making**: Using data, not just intuition, to make changes.\n\n### The PDCA Cycle:\n1. **Plan**: Identify the problem and plan the improvement.\n2. **Do**: Implement the change on a small scale.\n3. **Check**: Use data to analyze the results.\n4. **Act**: If successful, implement the change on a wider scale."

      "content": "Inversion (reversing the subject and the auxiliary verb) is used in formal writing and presentations to emphasize a point. It usually follows a negative or restrictive adverb.\n\n### Common Structures:\n- **Never/Seldom/Rarely**: *Never have we seen such high efficiency.*\n- **Not only... but also**: *Not only did we reduce waste, but we also improved speed.*\n- **Under no circumstances**: *Under no circumstances should the audit files be left open.*\n- **Only then**: *Only then did we realize the process was broken.*\n- **At no time**: *At no time was the customer data at risk.*"

In TQM, all members of an organization participate in improving processes, products, services, and the culture in which they work.\n\n### Core Tenets of TQM:\n- **Total Employee Involvement**: People are the most important resource. Everyone must be trained and committed.\n- **Process-Centered**: A fundamental part of TQM is a focus on process thinking.\n- **Integrated System**: Quality is not just a department; it's the whole company's responsibility.\n- **Strategic and Systematic Approach**: Achieving an organization's vision, mission, and goals."

      "content": "A quality culture is only possible when employees are **empowered** and **engaged**. This means moving away from a 'blame culture' to a 'learning culture'.\n\n### Strategies for Engagement:\n- **Suggestion Schemes**: Providing a platform for staff to propose improvements.\n- **Recognition**: Rewarding teams that successfully eliminate waste or improve efficiency.\n- **Quality Circles**: Groups of employees who meet regularly to solve work-related problems.\n\n### Vocabulary Definitions:\n- **Empowered**: Having the knowledge, skill, and authority to make decisions.\n- **Engagement**: The level of enthusiasm and dedication a worker feels toward their job.\n- **Benchmark**: A standard or point of reference against which things may be compared."

In administration, this means removing steps that do not add value to the end customer.\n\n### The 8 Wastes of Lean (Muda):\n- **Defects**: Information that is incorrect or missing.\n- **Overproduction**: Doing more work than is required (e.g., printing unnecessary copies).\n- **Waiting**: Delays between steps in a process.\n- **Non-utilized Talent**: Not using the skills of the staff effectively.\n- **Transportation**: Unnecessary movement of documents or information.\n- **Inventory**: Excessive backlog of work.\n- **Motion**: Unnecessary movement by people (e.g., walking to a distant printer).\n- **Extra-Processing**: Using more complex tools than necessary for a simple task."
