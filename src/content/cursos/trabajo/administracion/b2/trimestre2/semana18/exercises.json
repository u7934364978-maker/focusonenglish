However, we have identified a need for better task prioritisation. It is the occasional missed deadline for non-urgent requests that we need to address in the next quarter.\n\nSMART Goal: The employee will attend a 'Time Management' workshop and implement a daily prioritisation list. By the end of Q3, we expect to see a 100% on-time delivery rate for all administrative tasks. What we need for the next phase is a continued focus on professional growth and attention to detail.",
