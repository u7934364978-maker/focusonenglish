      "content": "Change management is a structured approach to transitioning individuals, teams, and organisations from a current state to a desired future state. Innovation, on the other hand, is the practical implementation of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or services or improvement in offering goods or services.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Resistance to Change**: The act of opposing or struggling with modifications or transformations that alter the status quo.\n- **Agile Methodology**: A way of managing projects by breaking them into several stages and involving constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage.\n- **Disruptive Innovation**: Innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market.\n- **Change Agents**: Individuals within an organisation who act as catalysts for change, helping to manage the transformation process."

      "content": "In professional contexts, we often use alternatives to 'if' to express conditions more precisely or formally.\n\n### Conditional Linkers\n- **Provided that / Providing that**: More formal than 'if'. Often used in contracts or official statements.\n  - *We will approve the budget **provided that** the ROI exceeds 15%.*\n- **As long as / So long as**: Emphasizes the duration or the strictness of the condition.\n  - ***As long as** employees feel supported, they will adapt to the new processes.*\n- **Unless**: Means 'if not' or 'except if'.\n  - *The merger will fail **unless** both cultures are successfully integrated.*\n- **On condition that**: Very formal. Used for specific agreements.\n  - *The loan was granted **on condition that** the company undergoes an audit.*\n- **Suppose / Supposing**: Used to ask about imaginary situations or to invite speculation.\n  - ***Supposing** the market crashes, what is our contingency plan?*"
