      "content": "Intellectual Property refers to creations of the mind. In administration, managing IP involves protecting the organisation's inventions, brands, and creative works through patents, trademarks, and copyrights.\n\n### Types of IP Protection:\n- **Patent**: Protection for an invention (e.g., a new engine design).\n- **Trademark**: Protection for signs, logos, or expressions (e.g., a brand name).\n- **Copyright**: Protection for original creative works (e.g., software code, manuals).\n- **Trade Secret**: Confidential business information (e.g., the Coca-Cola formula).\n\n### Admin Responsibilities:\nAdministrators often manage the filing deadlines, liaise with patent attorneys, and ensure that NDAs (Non-Disclosure Agreements) are signed by all relevant parties."

Administrators must track strict deadlines to ensure protection isn't lost.\n\n### The Filing Timeline:\n1. **Priority Date**: The date the first application is filed. It establishes your place in line.\n2. **12-Month Rule**: Most countries allow 12 months from the priority date to file international applications.\n3. **Publication**: Applications are usually published 18 months after the priority date.\n4. **Grant**: The final approval of the patent, which can take several years.\n\n### Admin Tasks:\n- **Docketing**: Maintaining a calendar of all IP-related deadlines.\n- **Liaising**: Communicating between internal inventors and external patent attorneys.\n- **Fee Management**: Ensuring 'maintenance fees' are paid to keep the patent active."

Organizations use international treaties to simplify the process.\n\n### Key Systems:\n- **WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization)**: The UN agency that coordinates international IP protection.\n- **PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty)**: Allows an inventor to file one 'international' application that can later be turned into many national patents.\n- **Madrid System**: A similar simplified process for registering trademarks in multiple countries.\n\n### Vocabulary:\n- **Jurisdiction**: The territory where a patent is legally enforceable.\n- **Prior Art**: Any evidence that your invention is already known (which could disqualify your patent)."

      "content": "Before a patent is filed, an invention is a **Trade Secret**. If the information is leaked publicly, it may become unpatentable. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) are the primary tool for protection.\n\n### Types of NDAs:\n- **Unilateral**: One party agrees to keep the other's information secret (common for hires).\n- **Mutual (Bilateral)**: Both parties share secrets and agree to keep them confidential (common for partnerships).\n\n### Admin Responsibilities:\n- **Verification**: Ensuring an NDA is signed *before* any technical data is shared.\n- **Archiving**: Maintaining a secure database of all active confidentiality agreements.\n- **Enforcement Alerts**: Notifying the legal team if a breach of contract is suspected."

      "content": "When IP is infringed, legal action (litigation) may be necessary. Administrators support the legal team during the **Discovery** phase.\n\n### The Discovery Phase:\nThis is the process of collecting evidence to prove or disprove a claim. Administrators help by:\n- **Document Collection**: Gathering emails, design logs, and meeting minutes from the time of invention.\n- **Preservation Orders**: Ensuring that no relevant documents are deleted once a dispute begins.\n- **Witness Coordination**: Scheduling depositions for the engineers or managers involved.\n\n### Common Outcomes:\n- **Injunction**: A court order to stop the competitor from selling the infringing product.\n- **Damages**: Financial compensation for the loss of revenue.\n- **Out-of-court Settlement**: Reaching an agreement without a full trial."
