From the initial due diligence to the final integration of two companies, administrators play a key role in managing documentation, schedules, and communication.\n\n### Key M&A Stages:\n1. **Pre-deal Due Diligence**: Thoroughly investigating the target company's assets, liabilities, and operations.\n2. **Valuation & Negotiation**: Determining the price and terms of the deal.\n3. **Closing**: Finalising the legal and financial transfer of ownership.\n4. **Post-Merger Integration (PMI)**: Combining the two organisations' systems, cultures, and staff."

      "content": "Mixed conditionals are used to link a hypothetical past with a present result, or a hypothetical present state with a past result. They are essential for discussing the long-term impacts of strategic decisions like mergers.\n\n### Type A: Past Action -> Present Result (If + Past Perfect, would + base verb)\n- **If we had merged** last year, we **would be** the market leader now. (We didn't merge, so we aren't the leader).\n- **If they hadn't signed** the LOI, we **wouldn't be** in this mess today.\n\n### Type B: Present State -> Past Result (If + Past Simple, would have + past participle)\n- **If the company were** more stable, the merger **would have been** easier. (The company isn't stable, so the merger was difficult).\n- **If I knew** the CEO better, I **would have asked** for more information during the meeting."

Administrators are often responsible for its setup and maintenance.\n\n### Admin Responsibilities in VDR Management:\n- **User Permissions**: Granting and revoking access to bidders, lawyers, and accountants.\n- **Document Indexing**: Organizing files into a logical folder structure (e.g., Finance, Legal, HR, IP).\n- **Watermarking**: Ensuring all downloaded documents have a security watermark to prevent leaks.\n- **Q&A Management**: Tracking questions from bidders and coordinating responses from subject matter experts (SMEs).\n\n### Benefits of a VDR:\n- **Security**: Granular control over who can see, print, or download specific files.\n- **Audit Trail**: Tracking every action taken by every user (who looked at what, and when).\n- **Efficiency**: Allows multiple bidders to review documents simultaneously from anywhere in the world."
