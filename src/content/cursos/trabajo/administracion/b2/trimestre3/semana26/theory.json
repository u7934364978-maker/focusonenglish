      "content": "Mixed conditionals are used to link a hypothetical past with a present result, or a hypothetical present state with a past result. They are essential for discussing the long-term impacts of strategic decisions like mergers.\n\n### Type A: Past Action -> Present Result (If + Past Perfect, would + base verb)\n- **If we had merged** last year, we **would be** the market leader now. (We didn't merge, so we aren't the leader).\n- **If they hadn't signed** the LOI, we **wouldn't be** in this mess today.\n\n### Type B: Present State -> Past Result (If + Past Simple, would have + past participle)\n- **If the company were** more stable, the merger **would have been** easier. (The company isn't stable, so the merger was difficult).\n- **If I knew** the CEO better, I **would have asked** for more information during the meeting."
