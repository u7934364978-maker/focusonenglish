      "text": "Results of the Q2 Culture Audit\n\nThe recent audit shows that while 'hygiene factors' like salary and office facilities are meeting expectations, employee morale has dipped. Staff reported feeling that their hard work goes unrecognized. \n\nWe must stop focusing only on output and start fostering a culture of recognition. We tried increasing the coffee budget last month, but this had little impact on engagement. What we need is intrinsic motivation. \n\nI remember speaking to the team about professional development goals last year; we must ensure these are followed up. I regret to say that if turnover remains high, we will struggle to meet our Q4 targets.",
