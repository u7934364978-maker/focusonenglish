Emails appearing to be from 'HR Payroll' are being sent to employees, asking them to 'verify' their bank details via a suspicious link.\n\nStaff members receiving such emails should not click on any links. Any data provided via these links could be used for identity theft. The IT team, whom we have alerted, is currently blocking the sender's domain. \n\nRemember: Security protocols established by the company must be followed at all times. Passwords shared with others or stored in plain text are a major risk factor. \n\nStay vigilant,\nCyber Security Team",
