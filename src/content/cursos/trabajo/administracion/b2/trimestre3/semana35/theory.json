Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a management concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and interactions with their stakeholders.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Whistleblowing**: The act of reporting waste, fraud, abuse, corruption, or dangers to public health and safety to someone who is in the position to rectify the wrongdoing.\n- **Conflict of Interest**: A situation in which a person or organisation is involved in multiple interests, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation for an act in another.\n- **Sustainability**: Meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n- **Ethical Audit**: A systematic evaluation of an organisation's ethics programme and performance to determine its effectiveness."
