The building was fully evacuated within 4 minutes and 30 seconds, which is within our target of 5 minutes. \n\nObservations:\n1. All fire wardens were present and followed their protocols correctly.\n2. One fire exit in the basement was partially blocked by cleaning supplies. This hazard must be addressed immediately. \n3. A few staff members attempted to take their laptops with them. In the future, ensure that all personal items are left behind to speed up the evacuation.\n\nRemember: In a real emergency, the lifts shall not be used under any circumstances.",
