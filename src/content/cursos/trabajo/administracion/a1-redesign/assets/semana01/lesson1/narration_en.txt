Welcome to your first lesson in Administrative English! In a professional environment, how you greet people sets the tone for your entire day. Whether you are walking into the office or joining a virtual meeting, choosing the right words is essential.

In English, we distinguish between two main types of greetings. Formal greetings are used for managers, clients, or people you don't know well. They show respect and professionalism. For example, use "Good morning" before noon, "Good afternoon" until 6 PM, and "Good evening" later in the day.

On the other hand, informal greetings are perfect for close colleagues and teammates in a relaxed office culture. You can use a simple "Hi" or "Hey", or ask "How's it going?". Remember, while these are friendly, it's always safer to start formal if you are unsure. Let's practice!
