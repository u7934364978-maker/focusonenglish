In our third lesson, we are moving from speaking to writing. Professional emails are a daily part of office life, and they always begin with a greeting. The greeting you choose depends on who you are writing to and how well you know them.

For formal emails, especially to someone you haven't met, use "Dear [Name]". For example, "Dear Mr. Smith" or "Dear Ms. Jones". If you don't know the name, "Dear Hiring Manager" is a professional alternative. Always follow the greeting with a comma or a colon.

For colleagues you work with every day, a semi-formal "Hi [Name]" or "Hello [Name]" is usually appropriate. After the greeting, it's common to include a polite opening line like "I hope you are having a good week". These small touches make your emails more professional and pleasant to read.
