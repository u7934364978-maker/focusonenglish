Today we are focusing on one of the most important moments in your career: the job interview. In English-speaking interviews, your introduction and first greeting are crucial. You want to appear confident, professional, and friendly from the very first second.

When you enter the room or start the call, use a formal greeting like "Good morning" or "Hello". Follow this by introducing yourself clearly: "Hello, my name is..." or "It's a pleasure to meet you". Remember to smile and maintain eye contact, as these non-verbal cues are just as important as your words.

After the initial greeting, the interviewer might ask "How are you?". A simple and professional response is "I'm very well, thank you. How are you?". This shows you are polite and ready to begin. Practice these simple phrases until they feel natural, and you'll start every interview with confidence!
