In a job interview, you will often be asked common questions like "Tell me about yourself" or "Why do you want this job?". These questions are designed to help the employer understand your personality and your motivations for applying.

It is helpful to prepare short, clear answers for these common questions. Focus on your professional background and why you are a good fit for the company. Practice your answers out loud to build confidence and ensure you speak clearly.

Remember to listen carefully to the interviewer and take a moment to think before you answer. Being well-prepared will help you stay calm and perform your best during the interview. Good luck with your practice today!
