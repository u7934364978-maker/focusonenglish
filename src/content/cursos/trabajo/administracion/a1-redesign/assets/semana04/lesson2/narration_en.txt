When talking about your work experience, use action verbs like "managed", "organized", or "assisted". For example, you can say "I managed the reception desk" or "I assisted the director with daily tasks". This makes your experience sound professional and active.

Even if you don't have a lot of experience, you can talk about your skills and what you have learned in your studies. Focus on transferable skills like communication, teamwork, and organization. These are valuable in any administrative role.

Practice describing your past roles or responsibilities using simple sentences. Start with "In my last job, I..." or "During my studies, I...". This will help you feel more comfortable when sharing your background with others.
