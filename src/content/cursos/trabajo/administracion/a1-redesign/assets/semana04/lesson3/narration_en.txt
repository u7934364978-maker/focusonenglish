In an office, you will often need to fill out forms with personal information. Common fields include Name, Address, Phone Number, and Email Address. It is important to know these terms in English so you can provide accurate information quickly.

When filling out a form, pay attention to specific instructions like "Block Capitals" or "Signature". Block capitals means you should write in all uppercase letters. Your signature is how you sign your name officially at the end of a document.

Double-check your information before submitting a form. Accurate data is essential for administrative tasks like payroll, insurance, and communication. Practicing with sample forms will make you more confident in real-life office situations.
