A memo, or memorandum, is a short document used for internal communication within an office. It is usually less formal than a business letter but should still be professional. Memos are often used to announce changes, share information, or remind staff of upcoming events.

The header of a memo typically includes four fields: To, From, Date, and Subject. This allows the reader to quickly see who the message is for and what it is about. The body of the memo should be direct and get straight to the point.

Use bullet points or numbered lists if you are sharing multiple pieces of information or instructions. This makes the memo easier to scan and understand. End the memo with a clear call to action if necessary, such as "Please RSVP by Friday".
