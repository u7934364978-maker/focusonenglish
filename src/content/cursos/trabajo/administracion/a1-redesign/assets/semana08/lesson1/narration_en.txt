A business letter has a specific structure that makes it look professional. It starts with your contact information, the date, and the recipient's information. This is followed by a formal greeting, such as "Dear Mr. Smith" or "To Whom It May Concern".

The body of the letter should be clear and concise. State the purpose of your letter in the first paragraph. Use professional language and avoid using slang or informal abbreviations. Each paragraph should focus on one main idea to make the letter easy to read.

Finally, end your letter with a formal closing like "Sincerely" or "Best regards", followed by your signature and printed name. Following this standard layout ensures that your business correspondence is taken seriously and reflects well on your company.
