Most offices have standard working hours, often referred to as "nine-to-five". Full-time employees usually work forty hours a week, while part-time employees work fewer hours. Some offices also use shift work, where hours can change each week.

To talk about your working hours, use the phrase "from... to...". For example, you can say "I work from nine AM to five PM". This is a clear and professional way to inform your colleagues or manager about your availability during the day.

Your office schedule might also include breaks. Knowing when the office is open and closed helps you plan your tasks and meetings effectively. Understanding these terms ensures you are always aligned with your team's schedule.
