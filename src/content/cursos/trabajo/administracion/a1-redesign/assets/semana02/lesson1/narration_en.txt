In the office, you might need to check the time for a meeting or a break. Common questions are "What time is it?" or more politely, "Excuse me, do you have the time?". Knowing how to ask for the time is a basic but essential skill for any professional.

The simplest way to tell the time in English is to say the numbers. For nine o'clock, you say "It's nine o'clock". For nine fifteen, just say "It's nine fifteen". If it is nine thirty, you can say "It's nine thirty" or use the common phrase "half past nine".

Practice asking your colleagues for the time today. It is a great way to start a conversation and ensure you are always on time for your appointments. Remember, being punctual is highly valued in an office environment!
