Taking messages accurately is a vital skill for anyone working in an office. When you answer the phone for someone else, always have a pen and paper ready. Make sure to get the caller's name, their company, and their phone number.

Ask for the purpose of the call so you can provide a helpful summary to your colleague. You can say "May I ask what this is regarding?" or "Would you like to leave a brief message?". This helps your colleague prioritize their return calls.

Finally, repeat the information back to the caller to ensure everything is correct. Say "Let me check that: Your name is John Doe, and your number is...". Once the call is over, deliver the message promptly to the right person. Accurate messages prevent misunderstandings and save time.
