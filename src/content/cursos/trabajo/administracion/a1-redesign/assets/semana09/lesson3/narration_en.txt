In a global business environment, you will often need to answer calls from people in different time zones. It is helpful to know common phrases for managing these situations. For example, "It is currently 9:00 AM here" or "I am calling from London".

When scheduling a follow-up call, always specify the time zone to avoid confusion. You can say "Let's speak at 3:00 PM London time". This ensures that everyone knows exactly when to expect the call and prevents missed connections.

If the connection is poor, it is professional to inform the other person and offer to call back. You can say "I'm sorry, the connection is bad. Could I call you back in five minutes?". Being clear and polite helps manage the challenges of international communication.
