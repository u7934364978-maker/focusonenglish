Handling a phone call professionally starts with a polite greeting. You should state the company name and then your own name. For example, "Focus English, this is Maria speaking. How can I help you?". This is a standard and welcoming way to answer.

If you need to put someone on hold, always ask for permission first. Say "Could I put you on hold for a moment while I check that?". When you return to the call, thank them for waiting by saying "Thank you for your patience".

When ending a call, summarize any actions that were agreed upon. You can say "So, I will send you that email by the end of the day". Finally, end with a polite closing like "Thank you for calling" or "Have a great day". Professional phone manners leave a positive impression on clients and partners.
