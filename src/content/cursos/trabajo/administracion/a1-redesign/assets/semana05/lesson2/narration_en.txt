In a professional setting, it is important to choose the right level of formality when making a request. For a formal request, use "Could you please..." or "I would appreciate it if...". This is appropriate for managers or people you don't know well.

For informal requests with close colleagues, you can use "Can you..." or "Would you mind...". However, always remember to include "please" and "thank you" to remain polite. Being respectful is key to maintaining good working relationships.

Practice turning informal requests into formal ones. For example, "Send me the file" becomes "Could you please send me the file?". This simple change makes your communication much more professional and effective.
