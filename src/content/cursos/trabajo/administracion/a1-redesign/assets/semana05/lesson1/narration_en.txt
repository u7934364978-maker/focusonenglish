The subject line is the most important part of an email. it should be short, clear, and describe exactly what the email is about. For example, "Meeting Request" or "Invoice #1234" are good, professional subject lines.

Avoid using vague subject lines like "Hello" or "Important". A specific subject line helps the recipient prioritize their emails and find your message later. It also shows that you are organized and professional.

When writing a subject line, think about what the recipient needs to know immediately. If there is a deadline, you can include it, like "Report Due - Friday Oct 25". This small detail can make a big difference in how quickly your email is handled.
