Following up after a meeting is essential to ensure that decisions are turned into actions. The person who took the minutes will usually send a summary to all participants. This summary includes "Action Items", which are specific tasks assigned to individuals.

If you have been assigned a task, make sure you understand the deadline and what is expected of you. If you are unsure, send a quick email to the meeting leader to clarify. This shows that you are proactive and responsible.

Even if you weren't assigned a specific task, it is professional to send a short thank-you email to the meeting leader, especially if it was an important discussion. A simple "Thank you for the productive meeting today" goes a long way in building professional rapport.
