Meetings are a regular part of office life. They usually have an agenda, which is a list of topics to be discussed. Knowing the different parts of a meeting will help you participate more effectively and follow the conversation.

The person leading the meeting is often called the "Chair" or "Facilitator". They will start the meeting, introduce the topics, and ensure everyone has a chance to speak. Someone else may take "minutes", which are the official notes of what was decided.

During a meeting, it is important to listen and wait for your turn to speak. If you have a question, you can say "Could I ask a question?" or "I have a point to add". This shows that you are engaged and respectful of the meeting process.
