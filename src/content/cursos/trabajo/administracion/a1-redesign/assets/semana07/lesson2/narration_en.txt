Ordering office supplies often involves using a catalog or an online portal. You will need to know terms like "item number", "quantity", and "unit price". Item number is the unique code for a product, and quantity is how many you want to buy.

When you place an order, you might need to ask for approval first. You can say "Could you please approve this order for notebooks?" or "Is it okay to order more ink cartridges?". Getting approval ensures that the office stays within its budget.

Once the order arrives, it is important to check the items against the delivery note. This note lists everything that was sent in the package. If something is missing or damaged, report it to your supervisor or the supplier immediately.
