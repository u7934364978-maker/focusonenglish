To form a question in English using the verb 'To Be', we simply swap the position of the subject and the verb. For example, "You are a manager" becomes "Are you a manager?". This is a very common way to ask about someone's job or status.

When someone asks you a question like this, you can give a short and polite answer. If the answer is yes, say "Yes, I am." If the answer is no, say "No, I am not." You don't need to repeat the whole sentence, just the short form is enough.

Let's practice! Imagine someone asks if you are the new receptionist. How would you answer? Practice these questions and answers with a partner to become more confident in your office conversations.
