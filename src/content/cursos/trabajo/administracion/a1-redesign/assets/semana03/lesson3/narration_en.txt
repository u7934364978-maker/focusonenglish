Identifying office equipment is an essential skill for any office worker. Common items include computers, printers, telephones, and staplers. Knowing the names of these tools in English will help you ask for help or report problems.

When you want to know what something is, you can ask "What is this?" for items that are close to you, or "What is that?" for items that are further away. This is a very useful question when you are learning your way around a new office.
