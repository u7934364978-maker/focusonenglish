  "content": "# Conflict Resolution in Banking\n\nHandling difficult situations and unhappy customers is a critical skill for banking professionals. The goal is to resolve issues while maintaining the bank's reputation and customer loyalty.\n\n## The L.A.S.T. Method\nOne effective technique for handling complaints is the **LAST** method:\n1. **Listen**: Let the customer explain the problem without interruption.\n2. **Apologize**: Offer a sincere apology for the situation, even if it's not your personal fault.\n3. **Solve**: Find a solution or explain the steps being taken to fix the issue.\n4. **Thank**: Thank the customer for bringing the matter to your attention.\n\n## Key Vocabulary for Resolution\n- **Escalation**: Moving a complaint to a higher level of management.\n- **Compensation**: Something given to make up for a mistake or loss.\n- **Discrepancy**: A lack of compatibility or similarity between two or more facts (e.g., a mistake in a statement).\n- **Goodwill Gesture**: A small gift or service offered to maintain a good relationship.\n\n## Professional Language\nInstead of saying \"I can't help you,\" say \"Let me see what I can do to resolve this for you.\"",
