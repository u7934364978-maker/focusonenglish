      "content": "Negotiating restructuring requires formal, precise language to manage expectations and legal liability.\n\n- **Concession Clauses**: \n  - '**Notwithstanding** the recent losses, the board remains optimistic.'\n  - '**Albeit** challenging, the restructuring plan is the only viable path.'\n  - 'We will accept the terms, **even though** they are less than ideal.'\n- **Nominalization**: Turning verbs into nouns to sound more formal and objective.\n  - 'We **implemented** the plan' -> 'The **implementation** of the plan was successful.'\n  - 'The bank **refused** to lend' -> 'The bank's **refusal** to lend triggered the crisis.'"
