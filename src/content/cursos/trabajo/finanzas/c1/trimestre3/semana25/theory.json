      "content": "Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) are driven by the search for value creation. Executives must articulate the 'Strategic Rationale' behind a deal.\n\n- **Synergy**: The concept that the value and performance of two companies combined will be greater than the sum of the separate individual parts (1+1=3).\n- **Types of Synergy**: \n  - *Operating Synergies*: Cost savings from economies of scale or revenue enhancements from cross-selling.\n  - *Financial Synergies*: Lower cost of capital or tax benefits.\n- **Accretive vs. Dilutive**: An acquisition is 'accretive' if the acquiring company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) increases after the deal. It is 'dilutive' if the EPS decreases."

      "content": "In M&A negotiations, we often discuss how past decisions affect current situations or how permanent facts would have changed past outcomes.\n\n- **Past result, present condition**: 'If the board **hadn't approved** the merger last year, our market share **would be** much lower today.'\n- **Present condition, past result**: 'If we **were** a larger company, we **could have outbid** our competitor for that startup.'\n- **Advanced Speculation**: 'Should the valuation **prove** inaccurate, the goodwill impairment **would be** substantial.'"
