      "content": "Auditing is the systematic examination of financial records to ensure accuracy, reliability, and compliance with established standards.\n\n### The Concept of Materiality\nIn auditing, **Materiality** refers to the significance of an amount, transaction, or error. An item is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users. Auditors focus their efforts on areas where the risk of material misstatement is highest.\n\n### Internal vs. External Audit\n- **Internal Audit**: An ongoing, independent appraisal function within an organization. It focuses on improving operational efficiency, internal controls, and risk management.\n- **External Audit**: A periodic examination by an outside firm (e.g., the Big Four) to provide an independent opinion on whether the financial statements present a 'true and fair view' of the company's position."
