Indicates how many times a company has sold and replaced inventory during a period.\n- **DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)**: (Average Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) × Number of Days. Measures the average number of days it takes to collect payment after a sale has been made.\n- **Total Asset Turnover**: Revenue / Average Total Assets. Measures the efficiency of a company's assets in generating revenue."

It represents the blended cost of debt and equity.\n- **Terminal Value**: The value of a company's expected cash flow beyond the explicit forecast period (usually 5-10 years), calculated using the **Gordon Growth Method** or an **Exit Multiple**."
