      "content": "Equity markets allow companies to raise capital by selling shares to investors. This process is often facilitated by investment banks acting as underwriters.\n\n### The IPO Journey\n- **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**: The first time a private company offers its shares to the public. It provides liquidity for early investors and capital for expansion.\n- **Underwriting**: The process where a financial institution (the underwriter) guarantees the sale of the shares and assumes the risk of unsold stock.\n- **Roadshow**: A series of presentations to potential institutional investors to generate interest and determine the offer price.\n- **Secondary Offering**: When a company that is already public issues additional shares to raise more capital."

      "content": "Companies and governments raise debt by issuing bonds. Unlike equity, debt must be repaid with interest.\n\n### Core Bond Concepts\n- **Coupon Rate**: The annual interest rate paid by the bond issuer to the bondholder.\n- **Maturity Date**: The date on which the principal amount of the bond is due to be repaid.\n- **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**: The total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures.\n- **Credit Ratings**: Assessments by agencies like S&P, Moody's, and Fitch that evaluate the issuer's ability to repay debt. 'Investment Grade' bonds are considered safer, while 'High Yield' (or Junk) bonds offer higher returns for higher risk."
