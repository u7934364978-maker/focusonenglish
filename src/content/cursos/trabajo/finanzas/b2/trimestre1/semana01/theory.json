      "content": "Investment banking differs significantly from retail banking. While retail banks deal with individuals and small businesses, investment banks work with large corporations and governments.\n\n### Key Activities\n1. **Underwriting**: Assisting companies in issuing new securities (stocks or bonds). The bank guarantees a price and buys any shares not sold to the public.\n2. **M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions)**: Advising companies on buying other companies (acquisition) or merging with them. This involves valuation, negotiation, and structuring the deal.\n3. **Asset Management**: Managing large portfolios of investments for institutional clients like pension funds or insurance companies.\n4. **Sales & Trading**: Buying and selling financial instruments (stocks, bonds, derivatives) on behalf of clients or for the bank's own account.\n\n### Essential Terminology\n- **IPO (Initial Public Offering)**: The first time a private company offers its stock to the public to raise capital.\n- **Due Diligence**: The thorough investigation of a business's financial, legal, and operational status before signing a contract.\n- **Leverage**: Using borrowed capital for an investment, expecting the profits made to be greater than the interest payable.\n- **Synergy**: The concept that the value and performance of two companies combined will be greater than the sum of the separate individual parts."

      "content": "Going public is a major milestone for any company. The process typically follows these stages:\n\n1. **Selection of an Investment Bank**: The company chooses one or more 'underwriters'.\n2. **Due Diligence and Filing**: Preparing the registration statement (prospectus) for regulators (like the SEC).\n3. **Pricing**: Determining the initial price per share based on market demand.\n4. **The Roadshow**: Presenting the investment opportunity to potential institutional investors.\n5. **Stabilization**: The underwriter may buy shares in the open market to support the price after the IPO."

      "content": "Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings. \n\n### Types of Risks\n- **Market Risk**: Potential losses due to changes in market prices, such as interest rates, exchange rates, or equity prices.\n- **Credit Risk**: The risk that a borrower or counterparty will default on their contractual obligations.\n- **Operational Risk**: Risks arising from internal failures, such as systems glitches, human error, or fraud.\n- **Liquidity Risk**: The risk that an entity will not be able to meet its short-term financial obligations because it cannot convert assets into cash quickly enough.\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategies\n- **Hedging**: Using financial instruments (like options or futures) to offset potential losses.\n- **Diversification**: Spreading investments across different assets or sectors to reduce exposure to any single risk.\n- **Insurance**: Transferring risk to a third party in exchange for a premium."

      "content": "In financial reporting and risk analysis, we often use modals to express different levels of certainty about the present and the past.\n\n### Present Deduction\n1. **Strong certainty (90-100%)**:\n   - *The market **must** be reacting to the central bank's announcement.*\n   - *That forecast **can't** be right; it ignores the recent inflation data.*\n\n2. **Probability (70-80%)**:\n   - *The merger **should** be finalized by the end of the quarter.*\n   - *We **ought to** see a recovery in the tech sector soon.*\n\n3. **Possibility (30-50%)**:\n   - *Interest rates **might/could/may** rise if the economy continues to overheat.*\n\n### Past Deduction\nWe use **Modal + Have + Past Participle** to speculate about the past:\n- **Must have**: *They **must have** performed due diligence, but they missed the hidden debt.*\n- **Can't have**: *The CEO **can't have** known about the fraud at that time.*\n- **Should have**: *The bank **should have** diversified its portfolio to avoid this loss.*\n- **Could have**: *The company **could have** gone public last year, but the market was too volatile.*"
