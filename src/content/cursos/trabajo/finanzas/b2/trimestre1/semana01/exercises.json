Fintechs have the tech and the innovation. By acquiring fintech startups, legacy banks can **leapfrog** their competition without building everything from scratch.\n\nAnalyst: But isn't there a risk of **overvaluation**? Some of these price tags are eye-watering.\n\nSarah: Certainly. **Due diligence** is more critical than ever. You have to look beyond the user growth and analyze the path to profitability. We're also seeing a lot of interest in 'Open Banking'. How is that affecting your strategy?\n\nSarah: **Open Banking** is a game-changer.
