      "content": "Trade finance bridges the trust gap between exporters and importers by using banks as intermediaries to manage payment and delivery risks.\n\n### Key Documentary Credits\n- **Letter of Credit (LC)**: A bank's guarantee that a seller will receive payment as long as certain delivery conditions are met. If the buyer cannot pay, the bank covers the amount.\n- **Bill of Lading (B/L)**: A legal document issued by a carrier to a shipper that details the type, quantity, and destination of the goods. It serves as a shipment receipt and a document of title.\n- **Documentary Collections**: A process where the exporter's bank collects payment from the importer's bank in exchange for shipping documents (Documents against Payment - D/P or Documents against Acceptance - D/A).\n\n### Guarantees and Standby LCs\n- **Bank Guarantee**: A promise from a bank to pay a beneficiary if the opposing party fails to fulfill contractual obligations.\n- **Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC)**: A 'payment of last resort' that is only triggered if the applicant defaults on a contract."

      "content": "Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers for the delivery of goods under sales contracts.\n\n### Common Incoterms\n- **EXW (Ex Works)**: The buyer bears all costs and risks from the seller's premises.\n- **FOB (Free on Board)**: The seller is responsible until the goods are loaded onto the vessel.\n- **CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight)**: The seller pays for transport and insurance to the destination port, but risk transfers once goods are on the ship.\n- **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid)**: The seller bears all risks and costs, including duties and taxes, until the goods reach the buyer's location.\n\n### Mitigating Global Risks\n- **Credit Risk**: The danger of a counterparty failing to pay.\n- **Political Risk**: Disruptions caused by government actions, war, or sanctions.\n- **Export Credit Agencies (ECAs)**: Government-backed entities that provide insurance and financing to support domestic exporters."

      "content": "Techniques used to optimize working capital and provide liquidity to supply chain partners.\n\n### Factoring vs. Forfaiting\n- **Factoring**: A business sells its accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party (a factor) at a discount to get immediate cash. Usually for short-term receivables.\n- **Forfaiting**: The purchase of an exporter's medium-to-long-term receivables (like bills of exchange) without recourse, meaning the forfaiter takes on all the risk of non-payment.\n\n### Reverse Factoring\nAlso known as **Supply Chain Finance (SCF)**, where a large buyer allows its suppliers to finance their invoices through the buyer's bank at a lower interest rate based on the buyer's superior credit rating."

      "content": "In trade finance, we often discuss how past events or present conditions affect future or hypothetical outcomes. Mixed conditionals are essential for these nuances.\n\n### Type 1: Past Action -> Present Result\n*Structure: If + Past Perfect, would + bare infinitive*\n- *\"If the exporter **had secured** a Letter of Credit last month, they **wouldn't be** facing this liquidity crisis now.\"*\n- (They didn't secure it, so they have a crisis now).\n\n### Type 2: Present Condition -> Past Result\n*Structure: If + Past Simple, would have + past participle*\n- *\"If our company **were** more risk-averse, we **would have insisted** on a 'Documents against Payment' arrangement.\"*\n- (We aren't very risk-averse, so we didn't insist on it in the past).\n\n### Professional Application\nUse these structures to analyze 'what went wrong' or to justify current strategy based on hypothetical past scenarios."
