          "stimulus_en": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting ecosystems and human societies worldwide. Many scientists argue that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary causes of the recent changes in our climate. These activities increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and extreme weather events. On the other hand, some skeptics question the extent of human impact, citing natural climate variability as a significant factor. They argue that the Earth has gone through cycles of warming and cooling long before industrialization. However, the majority of climate scientists emphasize that while natural cycles do occur, the current rapid changes are unprecedented and largely driven by human actions. To address climate change effectively, comprehensive international cooperation and innovative solutions, such as renewable energy investments, are essential. Without these efforts, the consequences could be dire, including rising sea levels, food insecurity, and widespread biodiversity loss.\n\nWhat are the primary causes of climate change according to most scientists?",
