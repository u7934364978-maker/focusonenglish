# English A1 Course Specifications

This document outlines the pedagogical objectives, vocabulary, grammar, and reading comprehension goals for each unit of the Focus English A1 course. Each unit consists of **60 exercises** designed to ensure mastery of the specified topics.

## Pedagogical & Technical Guidelines

To ensure high-quality learning, all exercises must follow these standards:

1.  **Pedagogical Logic**: Exercises must NOT be trivial. They should require actual comprehension and application of the level's objectives. Avoid "obvious" answers that can be guessed without reading the English text.
2.  **Full Translations**: EVERY English word in transcripts, questions, and reading passages must include its Spanish translation using the `[[English|Spanish]]` format. This includes common words and verbs that might be confused with Spanish (e.g., the English word "son" vs. the Spanish verb "son").
3.  **Randomized Answers**: Correct answers must be distributed across all options (A, B, C). Avoid patterns where "A" is consistently the correct choice.
4.  **Reading Structure**: Reading comprehension exercises must follow the two-phase navigation system:
    *   **Phase 1 (Reading)**: The full text passage (from the `transcript` field) is displayed first.
    *   **Phase 2 (Questions)**: Questions are presented only after the student has accessed the text.
5.  **Contextual Learning**: Vocabulary should be introduced in sentences or context whenever possible, rather than isolated words (except in initial flashcards).
6.  **Progressive Difficulty**: Within a unit, exercises should progress from simple recognition (flashcards/multiple choice) to production (sentence building).
