  title: 'Possessive \'s - Showing Relationships',
  grammarPoint: 'Possessive \'s with Family Members',
  explanation: `We use possessive 's to show relationships and ownership:

Formation:
• Singular noun + 's: John's sister, Maria's mother, Tom's father
• Plural noun ending in -s + ': my parents' house, the students' books
• Irregular plural + 's: children's room, women's bags

With Family Members:
• John's mother = the mother of John
• Sarah's brother = the brother of Sarah
• My sister's name = the name of my sister

Note: We use 's after the person who possesses or has the relationship.
The thing that is possessed comes after.`,
  examples: [
    'This is Tom\'s sister. (the sister of Tom)',
    'Maria\'s father is a doctor.',
    'My brother\'s wife is very nice.',
    'The children\'s grandmother lives with us.',

  text: `My Big Family

Hi! My name is Emma, and I want to tell you about my big family.

I live with my parents and my older brother. My mother\'s name is Susan. She\'s 45 years old and she\'s a nurse. My father\'s name is Michael. He\'s 48 years old and he works in a bank. My brother\'s name is Tom. He\'s 18 years old and he\'s a university student.

We\'re a close family. Every Sunday, we have lunch at my grandmother\'s house. My grandmother\'s name is Elizabeth, but we call her "Grandma Liz". She\'s 72 years old and she\'s very energetic! My grandfather passed away three years ago, so now Grandma Liz lives alone.

I have many cousins because my mother has three sisters and my father has one brother. My favorite cousin is Julia. She\'s my aunt Patricia\'s daughter. Julia is 16 years old, and we\'re like best friends. We go to the same school and we do everything together.

My uncle Robert, my father\'s brother, has two sons. Their names are Mike and Dave. Mike is 12 and Dave is 10. They\'re very funny boys. When we have family gatherings, we always have a great time playing together.

I also have a younger cousin named Sophie. She\'s only 5 years old. She\'s my aunt Maria\'s daughter. Sophie is so cute! She always wants to play with me.

I love my big family. Family is the most important thing in life!`,

Sarah: Sure! I have a small family. I live with my parents and my younger sister.

Person A: How old is your sister?

Sarah: She\'s 14. Her name is Amy. She\'s in high school.

Person A: That\'s nice. Do you have any brothers?

Sarah: No, I don\'t. It\'s just my sister and me. But I have many cousins!

Person A: Oh really? How many cousins do you have?

Sarah: I have five cousins. Three on my mother\'s side and two on my father\'s side.

Person A: Wow! Do you see them often?

Sarah: Yes, we have family dinners every month. My grandmother organizes them.

Person A: That sounds wonderful! Does your grandmother live with you?

Person A: And your grandfather?

Sarah: My grandfather lives in another city. He lives with my aunt Emma. We visit him twice a year.
