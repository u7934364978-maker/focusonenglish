      passage: 'The political economy of media — the study of how ownership, market structures and financial incentives shape media content and the conditions for journalistic practice — has generated a substantial body of research whose central conclusions are, it is fair to say, widely known within academic circles but rarely influential in public debate. Far from being a natural expression of freedom of speech, the contemporary media landscape is shaped by ownership structures, regulatory frameworks and market incentives that determine, often in ways invisible to audiences, what information is produced, how it is framed and whose interests it serves. It is widely acknowledged that the most commercially successful media enterprises — measured by audience size, revenue and influence — are not necessarily those that best serve the public-interest functions traditionally attributed to journalism in democratic theory. What distinguishes the political-economy tradition from conventional media studies is its emphasis on structural determinants rather than individual editorial choices: the argument is not that journalists are corrupt or biased individuals, but that the conditions within which they work systematically shape the range of perspectives and stories that are viable to pursue.',

      passage: 'The relationship between social media and democratic discourse is one of the most contested areas of contemporary social science. On one side of the debate stand those who argue that the empirical evidence for the supposed harms of social media to democracy is, compared to the volume and confidence of popular claims, relatively thin and often methodologically weak: studies of political polarisation, for instance, tend to find that the most polarised populations are also the least intensive users of social media, which is inconsistent with a simple causal story. On the other side are researchers who contend that focusing on direct causal effects on individual attitudes misses the more important structural changes: it is the transformation of the information environment — the weakening of common factual reference points, the fragmentation of shared narrative contexts — rather than individual attitude change, that poses the deeper democratic challenge. What both sides appear to agree on is that the question is extraordinarily complex and that confident claims in either direction are, compared to the evidence base, premature.',

      passage: 'Interviewer: Should social media platforms be regulated like traditional broadcasters? Expert A: Far from being a simple technical question, this is one that involves fundamental questions about the nature of public discourse and the role of private corporations in managing it. Unlike broadcasters, who have always operated under licences that require adherence to standards of accuracy and fairness, social media platforms have, it is widely noted, successfully resisted the application of equivalent standards, partly by positioning themselves as neutral conduits for user-generated speech rather than as editors. What makes this distinction increasingly difficult to sustain, however, is the evidence — now widely documented — that platform algorithms do not neutrally distribute content but actively curate what users see in ways that have measurable effects on political attitudes and social behaviour. Expert B: I would push back on that framing. It might well be argued that applying broadcast-style regulation to social media would, far from improving the information environment, restrict the scope for the kind of genuine public deliberation that the internet makes possible for the first time at scale. What is described as algorithmic curation is also, from another perspective, a form of personalised editorial service. There is a tendency to treat regulation as a solution when the underlying problems are deeper.',
