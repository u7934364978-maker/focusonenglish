      passage: 'It is increasingly accepted that the traditional model of lifelong employment with a single organisation is no longer the dominant paradigm for professional life in advanced economies. It has been observed that workers entering the labour market today are likely to hold an average of ten to fifteen different positions across multiple sectors during their careers. It is perhaps unsurprising, therefore, that younger generations place greater emphasis on skill transferability, personal fulfilment and flexibility than on institutional loyalty. It should be noted, however, that this shift carries risks: without the stability of long-term employment, workers may lack access to pension provision, healthcare and the legal protections historically associated with permanent contracts.',

      passage: 'It is now widely documented that the rapid expansion of remote work during the 2020s produced contradictory outcomes. It is true that many knowledge workers reported increased productivity and improved wellbeing when freed from lengthy commutes and open-plan offices. Yet it has also been established that remote work can erode the informal social bonds that sustain organisational cohesion, mentoring relationships and the transmission of institutional knowledge from experienced to junior staff. It is therefore argued by many management scholars that a hybrid model — combining structured in-office time with remote flexibility — offers the most viable path forward for most organisations.',
      questions: [{ question: 'What does the text suggest about fully remote work arrangements?', options: ['[[Remote work improves productivity for many but can weaken the social bonds and mentoring relationships that organisations depend on.|El teletrabajo mejora la productividad para muchos, pero puede debilitar los vínculos sociales y las relaciones de mentoría de las que dependen las organizaciones.]]', '[[Remote work has been conclusively proven to reduce productivity across all sectors, which is why hybrid models are now mandated.|Se ha demostrado de manera concluyente que el teletrabajo reduce la productividad en todos los sectores, por lo que los modelos híbridos son ahora obligatorios.]]', '[[Remote work has no effect on organisational culture because informal bonds are maintained digitally through collaboration tools.|El teletrabajo no tiene ningún efecto en la cultura organizacional porque los vínculos informales se mantienen digitalmente.]]'], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: 'The text acknowledges both benefits (productivity, wellbeing) and drawbacks (weakened social bonds, mentoring loss) of remote work.' }] },
