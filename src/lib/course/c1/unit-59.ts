      passage: 'Were the history of moral philosophy to be distilled into a single tension, it might be characterised as the conflict between two fundamental intuitions: that what matters morally is how things turn out — the welfare of actual beings, the reduction of suffering, the increase in well-being — and that certain actions are wrong in themselves, regardless of their consequences, because they violate duties, rights or the dignity of persons. Neither intuition can be dismissed without significant cost. A consequentialism that ignores individual rights produces monstrous conclusions in enough cases that even committed consequentialists have found it necessary to introduce deontological constraints through the back door. A deontology so rigid that it forbids lying to protect the innocent, or refuses to divert a trolley to save five at the cost of one, seems to be imposing formal consistency at the expense of the things that morality is supposed to serve. The most plausible moral theories are therefore hybrid: they take outcomes seriously without making them the sole criterion, and they respect persons as ends in themselves without treating rights as absolute constraints that override every other consideration. Whether this pragmatic pluralism represents genuine theoretical progress or a sophisticated evasion of the hard questions remains, notwithstanding the sophistication of contemporary ethical theory, deeply contested.',

      passage: 'The challenges of global governance in the twenty-first century differ from those of the twentieth in one fundamental respect: the most significant threats to human welfare are increasingly transnational in nature and therefore require cooperation among actors who lack the institutional relationships, shared norms and mutual trust that make cooperation possible. Climate change, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation, financial instability and the governance of artificial intelligence share a common structural feature: they cannot be adequately addressed by national governments acting unilaterally, yet the global institutions through which multilateral cooperation might be organised — the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade Organisation — were designed for a world in which sovereignty was less contested, interstate conflict was the primary security concern and technological change was slow enough that regulatory frameworks had time to catch up. The result is a governance gap: the problems are global, the solutions require global coordination, but the political will and institutional capacity to deliver that coordination are largely absent. Filling this gap — not merely with declarations of intent but with institutions that have genuine authority, adequate resources and effective enforcement mechanisms — is arguably the central political challenge of the coming decades.',

      passage: 'Professor: I want to conclude by returning to a question we raised at the start of the course: is there such a thing as a genuinely universal ethics — principles that apply to all human beings by virtue of their humanity, regardless of cultural context — or is morality irreducibly local, embedded in particular traditions, practices and forms of life that cannot be evaluated against some external standard? The cosmopolitan tradition answers: yes, there is. Were we to accept the premise that every human being possesses fundamental dignity and equal moral worth, it would follow that their basic interests — not to be tortured, not to starve when others have abundance, not to be arbitrarily killed — generate obligations on all of us, not just on fellow citizens. The communitarian response is that this cosmopolitanism, whilst appealing in the abstract, fails to account for the moral weight of special relationships and particular identities — it asks us to be citizens of the world rather than members of specific communities, and in doing so asks us to shed the very things that make us who we are. Student: So neither view is fully satisfactory? Professor: What most contemporary philosophers argue is that both capture something important — that universal obligations are real but not unlimited, that special relationships generate genuine but not absolute priority, and that working out where these competing claims should yield to one another is precisely what ethical reasoning requires.',
