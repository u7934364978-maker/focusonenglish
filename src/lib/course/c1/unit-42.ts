      passage: 'It is now well established that the conditions in which people are born, grow, live and work — rather than individual behaviour or access to healthcare alone — are the primary determinants of population health outcomes. Income, education, housing quality, exposure to environmental pollutants, social cohesion and early childhood experiences are all reported to exert independent and cumulative effects on physical and mental health across the life course. What distinguishes this perspective from earlier biomedical models is its emphasis on the upstream causes of illness: the social, economic and political structures that generate health inequalities in the first place. It has been contended that addressing these structural determinants requires policy interventions at a scale and ambition that most health systems — designed primarily to treat illness rather than prevent it — are institutionally ill-equipped to provide.',

      passage: 'The relationship between sleep and cognitive function is considerably more complex than the simple restorative model that dominated early sleep research. What is now understood is that sleep plays an active role in memory consolidation, emotional regulation and the clearance of metabolic waste products from the brain via the glymphatic system — a process that appears to be considerably more efficient during deep slow-wave sleep than in the waking state. It is reported that even a single night of inadequate sleep produces measurable impairments in executive function, working memory and emotional regulation that are comparable to those observed after moderate alcohol intoxication. Despite the growing body of evidence on the cognitive and physiological consequences of sleep deprivation, chronically inadequate sleep is still normalised — and in some professional cultures actively glorified — as a marker of productivity and ambition.',

      passage: 'Host: Today we are discussing the relationship between mental health and the workplace. What does the research tell us? Guest: The evidence is quite compelling. It is now widely accepted that working conditions — including job insecurity, excessive demands, lack of autonomy and poor management — are among the strongest predictors of depression, anxiety and burnout. What concerns me most is that despite this knowledge being available for decades, workplace mental health is still largely treated as an individual problem rather than a structural one. Host: Can you give an example of what structural intervention would look like? Guest: Certainly. What has been shown to be most effective is not simply providing employees with access to counselling, though that has its place, but redesigning work itself — reducing demands, increasing autonomy and ensuring that workloads are manageable. It is contended by some researchers that presenteeism — being at work while unwell — costs economies considerably more than absenteeism, yet it receives far less policy attention.',
