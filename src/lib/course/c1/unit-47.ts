      passage: 'Climate change presents one of the most intractable collective action problems in the history of international governance. There is every reason to believe that the structural incentives facing individual states — short electoral cycles, competitive pressures, domestic industry lobbying — systematically bias decision-making away from the long-term, costly emissions reductions that the scientific consensus demands. The problem is compounded by the fact that the costs of action are immediate and concentrated, whilst the benefits are deferred and diffuse: any country might well calculate that it is in its rational short-term interest to free-ride on the commitments of others whilst continuing to emit. This is not merely theoretical: the history of multilateral climate negotiations is replete with examples of states pledging ambitious targets whilst quietly undermining implementation through domestic policy decisions. It is conceivable that only the direct, visible experience of severe climate impacts on economically and politically significant populations will generate the political will for transformative action — a deeply troubling prospect from any perspective.',

    content: { title: '[[Reading|Lectura]]: [[Carbon Pricing|Fijación del precio del carbono]]', instructions: 'Read and answer.',
      passage: 'Among the policy instruments available to governments seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing — whether through a tax or a cap-and-trade system — is widely regarded by economists as the most efficient, as it creates a price signal that permeates the entire economy and allows market actors to identify the least costly abatement opportunities. There is reason to believe, however, that the theoretical elegance of carbon pricing has not translated into political palatability: carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes have faced fierce opposition from industries facing cost increases, as well as from households in lower income brackets disproportionately affected by energy price rises. It is conceivable that the political viability of carbon pricing could be substantially improved through the use of revenue recycling — returning the revenues to households as dividends or using them to reduce other taxes — though experience with such mechanisms has been uneven. The alternative — regulatory mandates and direct public investment — might well prove more politically durable in contexts where carbon pricing faces structural opposition, even if they are theoretically less efficient.',
      questions: [{ question: 'Why does the text say carbon pricing has faced political resistance despite being economically efficient?', options: ['[[Industries facing cost increases and lower-income households disproportionately affected by energy price rises have both opposed it, making the theoretical efficiency of carbon pricing difficult to translate into political viability.|Las industrias que enfrentan aumentos de costes y los hogares de ingresos más bajos afectados desproporcionadamente por el aumento de los precios de la energía se han opuesto a ello, dificultando traducir la eficiencia teórica en viabilidad política.]]', '[[Carbon pricing has faced political resistance primarily because it requires international coordination that is difficult to achieve given the fragmented nature of global climate governance and the divergent interests of major emitters.|La fijación del precio del carbono ha enfrentado resistencia política principalmente porque requiere coordinación internacional que es difícil de lograr.]]', '[[The political resistance stems from a general public misunderstanding of how carbon markets function, which has allowed fossil fuel industry lobbying campaigns to successfully mislead voters about the costs and benefits.|La resistencia política proviene de una incomprensión pública general sobre cómo funcionan los mercados de carbono, que ha permitido a las campañas de cabildeo de la industria de combustibles fósiles engañar con éxito a los votantes.]]'], correctAnswer: 0, explanation: 'The text says carbon pricing "has faced fierce opposition from industries facing cost increases, as well as from households in lower income brackets disproportionately affected by energy price rises".' }] },

      passage: 'Host: There is a lot of pessimism about the pace of climate action. Is it warranted? Guest: To a degree. The gap between pledges and implementation is real and well-documented. But it would be equally mistaken to dismiss what has been achieved. There is every reason to believe that the cost reductions in solar and wind energy over the past decade — which have been considerably faster than almost any forecaster predicted — might well continue, potentially reaching a tipping point where fossil fuels become economically uncompetitive across most applications within a generation. Host: But is that fast enough? Guest: That is the key question. It is conceivable that market forces alone, without more aggressive policy intervention, could deliver decarbonisation in power generation whilst leaving transport, industry, buildings and agriculture largely unreformed. The sectors where emissions are hardest to abate might well require very different policy instruments — potentially including public investment at scales that most governments have yet to contemplate. Host: What is your overall assessment? Guest: Cautiously optimistic about technology trajectories; considerably less optimistic about the political will to deploy the revenues and regulations needed to ensure a just and timely transition.',
