      passage: 'The post-1945 international order — built around multilateral institutions, binding treaty regimes and the progressive codification of international law — is under strain in ways that were not anticipated even two decades ago. Whereas the decade following the end of the Cold War was characterised by an optimistic expansion of multilateral cooperation, the current period is marked by the fragmentation of global governance, the rise of great power competition and the retreat of leading states from international obligations they previously championed. What is most troubling is not merely the weakening of specific institutions but the erosion of the normative consensus — the shared belief that multilateral rules-based cooperation is both legitimate and preferable to unilateral action — that underpinned the system. It is conceivable that this consensus could be rebuilt, but there is every reason to believe that such a reconstruction would require a level of political leadership and long-term vision that is currently conspicuous by its absence from the world stage.',

      passage: 'The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015, established seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) covering a comprehensive range of interconnected challenges — from poverty eradication and quality education to climate action, reduced inequalities and peace and justice. The SDGs represent an attempt to operationalise the concept of sustainable development — defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs — across every dimension of human activity. In contrast with their predecessors, the Millennium Development Goals, which applied primarily to developing countries, the SDGs are explicitly universal in scope: all countries, irrespective of income level, are obliged to develop national implementation strategies. Despite this ambition, progress has been uneven and, in some areas, has reversed since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the number of people living in extreme poverty rising for the first time in decades. It is feasible that the 2030 targets will not be met; by contrast, there is every reason to believe that the normative framework they represent could endure as a basis for global cooperation well beyond the deadline.',

      passage: 'Lecturer: Today I want to bring together the themes we have examined across this module — obligation, contrast, fronting, adverbial clauses and speculation — and apply them to a single integrating question: what does effective global governance require, and are we currently capable of delivering it? As for the requirement side of the question, there are several things we are obliged to acknowledge. First: effective global governance requires institutions with sufficient authority and resources to enforce agreed rules, lest they be treated as optional by powerful states that find compliance costly. Second: whereas developing countries have consistently advocated for stronger redistributive mechanisms, developed countries have resisted commitments they regard as open-ended financial obligations — this contrast is the central tension in virtually every area of global policy. Third: there is every reason to believe that governance gaps in areas such as digital technology, artificial intelligence and synthetic biology might well prove more consequential than any of the challenges we have yet managed to address multilaterally. It is conceivable that the 21st century will demand governance architectures that current institutional frameworks are wholly unprepared to provide.',
