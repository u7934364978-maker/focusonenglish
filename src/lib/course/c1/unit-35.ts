      passage: 'The distinction between the legal minimum wage and a living wage is not merely semantic. The minimum wage represents the lowest amount an employer is legally permitted to pay; a living wage, by contrast, is calculated on the basis of what employees actually need to meet essential living costs in a given location, including housing, food, transport and childcare. Critics of mandatory living wages argue that small businesses are bound to face unsustainable cost increases if forced to pay above the statutory minimum. Proponents counter that businesses paying poverty wages were never supposed to externalise their labour costs to the state through in-work benefits, and that higher wages would reduce staff turnover — a significant hidden cost that organisations have systematically underestimated.',

      passage: 'Executive compensation packages have expanded dramatically relative to median worker pay over the past four decades. In the United States, the ratio of chief executive pay to median worker pay stood at approximately twenty to one in 1965; by 2022, it had reached approximately three hundred and fifty to one. Defenders of high executive compensation argue that top leadership talent operates in a global market, and that companies which fail to compete for the best chief executives are bound to underperform relative to rivals who secure superior leadership. Critics respond that the empirical evidence linking high executive pay to superior company performance is weak, and that inflated compensation packages are largely the product of remuneration committees that are insufficiently independent from the executives whose pay they are supposed to set.',
