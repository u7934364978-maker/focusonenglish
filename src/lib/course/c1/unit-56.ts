      passage: 'Joseph Levine coined the phrase "the explanatory gap" to describe what he saw as a distinctive feature of consciousness that distinguishes it from other natural phenomena. We can explain water\'s transparency by reference to the way its molecular structure interacts with light — and once we understand that explanation, there is no residual question about why water with this structure should be transparent. The explanation is, as philosophers say, a priori: we could have worked it out without looking at water. Consciousness is different. Even if we were given a complete account of which neural processes in the brain are correlated with, or identical to, which conscious experiences, we could still meaningfully ask: but why does this brain process — rather than none at all, or some other experience — give rise to this particular sensation? The explanation always seems to leave a gap. The knowledge that C-fibres fire during pain explains the physiology of pain; it does not explain why there is something it is like to be in pain. This gap is not, Levine argued, merely a symptom of our current ignorance; it reflects something deep and possibly ineliminable about the relationship between the physical and the experiential.',

      passage: 'The question of whether artificial intelligence systems can be conscious is not merely an empirical question about the current capabilities of existing technology; it is a philosophical question about what consciousness requires. If functionalism is correct — if mental states are defined by their functional role, by the causal relations they bear to inputs, outputs and other states — then any system that realises the right functional organisation should, in principle, be conscious, regardless of what it is made of. On this view, the question of machine consciousness is open, and the hard problem is equally hard for biological and artificial systems. If, by contrast, consciousness requires something about the specific biological substrate — if there is something special about carbon-based, evolved neural tissue that silicon cannot replicate — then even a functional duplicate of a human brain would lack genuine conscious experience. This second view is more intuitive for many people but less well grounded philosophically: articulating precisely what it is about biological tissue that confers consciousness, and why that property could not be instantiated in other physical systems, turns out to be extremely difficult.',

      passage: 'Lecturer: Hume notoriously looked inward for the self and found, he said, nothing but a bundle of perceptions — impressions and ideas following one another in rapid succession, with no underlying "I" perceiving them. The self, on this account, is less like a theatre with a fixed stage on which the drama of mental life unfolds, and more like the drama itself: a series of scenes with no permanent backstage. This is a profoundly disorienting thought. We experience ourselves as unified, continuous persons persisting through time; Hume is saying that this experience is, at least in its metaphysical implications, an illusion — a construction imposed by memory and association on what is, in itself, a flux of disconnected events. Contemporary neuroscience has, interestingly, produced findings consistent with Hume\'s bundle theory: there is no single "self centre" in the brain, no neural correlate of the unified persisting subject of experience. The sense of self appears to be a construction — assembled from multiple, partly dissociable systems — rather than a discovery. Whether this vindicates Hume\'s metaphysics or merely describes the neural implementation of an otherwise legitimate concept remains, of course, contested.',
