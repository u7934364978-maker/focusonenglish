# Full SDD workflow

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Requirements

Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the feature description.

1. [x] Review existing codebase to understand current architecture and patterns
2. [x] Analyze the feature definition and identify unclear aspects
3. [x] Ask the user for clarifications on aspects that significantly impact scope or user experience
4. [x] Make reasonable decisions for minor details based on context and conventions
5. [x] If user can't clarify, make a decision, state the assumption, and continue

Save the PRD to `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/b0e6227d-4141-43bd-bed4-5bf69e95217e/requirements.md`.

### [x] Step: Technical Specification

Create a technical specification based on the PRD in `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/b0e6227d-4141-43bd-bed4-5bf69e95217e/requirements.md`.

1. [x] Review existing codebase architecture and identify reusable components
2. [x] Define the implementation approach

Save to `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/b0e6227d-4141-43bd-bed4-5bf69e95217e/spec.md` with:

- Technical context (language, dependencies)
- Implementation approach referencing existing code patterns
- Source code structure changes
- Data model / API / interface changes
- Delivery phases (incremental, testable milestones)
- Verification approach using project lint/test commands

### [x] Step: Planning

Create a detailed implementation plan based on `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/b0e6227d-4141-43bd-bed4-5bf69e95217e/spec.md`.

1. [x] Break down the work into concrete tasks
2. [x] Each task should reference relevant contracts and include verification steps
3. [x] Replace the Implementation step below with the planned tasks

### [ ] Step: Implementation

1. [x] Define full 100-unit syllabus (titles, topics, tags)
2. [x] Generate Units 2-10 (Module 1 complete)
3. [x] Generate Units 11-20 (Module 2)
4. [x] Generate Units 21-30 (Module 3)
5. [ ] Generate Units 31-40 (Module 4)
6. [ ] Generate Units 41-50 (Module 5)
7. [ ] Generate Units 51-60 (Module 6)
8. [ ] Generate Units 61-70 (Module 7)
9. [ ] Generate Units 71-80 (Module 8)
10. [ ] Generate Units 81-90 (Module 9)
11. [ ] Generate Units 91-100 (Module 10)
12. [ ] Final verification and JSON linting
