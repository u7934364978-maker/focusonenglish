# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Course "Negociaciones B2" Excellence & Expansion

## Overview
The goal is to transform the "Inglés para Negociaciones B2" course into a top-tier learning experience by significantly improving the User Experience (UX) and expanding the content to 50 practices per unit.

## Target Audience
Intermediate to Upper-Intermediate (B2) students looking to master English for business negotiations.

## Key Objectives
1. **UX Excellence**: Upgrade the course interface and interactions to provide a seamless, engaging, and highly professional learning experience.
2. **Content Expansion**: Scale each of the 4 units (lessons) in the course to include 50 exercises each, covering various aspects of negotiations (Vocabulary, Grammar, Listening, Speaking, Reading).

## UX Requirements ("Excellence")
### 1. Visual & Interactive Feedback
- **Celebration Animations**: Implement confetti or specialized animations when a student completes a block or a unit.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Enhance the visual distinction between correct and incorrect answers with subtle but clear animations (e.g., green pulse for correct, red shake for incorrect).
- **Sound Effects**: Add optional sound effects for success and failure (with a toggle to mute).

### 2. Progress & Navigation
- **Granular Progress**: Show progress at the question level within a block, not just at the block level.
- **Quick Navigation**: Allow students to jump between questions within a block if they want to review.
- **Session Persistence**: Ensure progress is saved in real-time so users can resume exactly where they left off.

### 3. Design Refinement
- **Focused UI**: Reduce visual noise during exercises to help students concentrate on the content.
- **Professional Aesthetics**: Use a color palette and typography that reflects a business environment (Blue, Slate, White).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimize all exercise types for mobile devices.

### 4. Gamification Integration
- **Real-time XP**: Show XP being earned immediately after each correct answer.
- **Streaks**: Display a "Correct Answer Streak" indicator.
- **Achievement Unlocks**: Add simple visual notifications when milestones are reached (e.g., "10 correct in a row").

## Content Expansion Requirements
