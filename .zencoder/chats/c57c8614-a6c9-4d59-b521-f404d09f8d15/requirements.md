# PRD - A1 Unit 1 Remake: Pedagogical Excellence

## Objective
Remake A1 Unit 1 ("Greetings and Personal Information") with a focus on professional pedagogical design. The unit should transition from simple recognition to active production, using engaging contexts and a clear learning progression.

## Target Audience
- **Level**: A1 (Beginner)
- **Profile**: Adult learners.

## Learning Objectives (Concepts)
1.  **Greetings & Farewells**: Formal vs. Informal (Good morning vs. Hi, Goodbye vs. See you later).
2.  **Introductions**: Introducing oneself and others ("I am...", "This is my colleague...").
3.  **Verb 'To Be' (Singular)**: Positive, negative, and question forms (I am, You are, He/She/It is).
4.  **Personal Info**: Name, Surname, Age (Numbers 1-20), Nationality, and Job.
5.  **Spelling**: The Alphabet (essential for names/emails).
6.  **Possessive Adjectives**: My, Your, His, Her.
7.  **Wh- Questions**: What is your name? Where are you from? How are you?

## Pedagogical Strategy (Engagement & Learning)
-   **Contextual Cast**: Introduce 3-4 diverse characters (e.g., Sarah from London, Marco from Rome) who interact in different scenarios.
-   **Scaffolding**: 
    - *Discovery*: Observe dialogues.
    - *Reinforcement*: Identify correct forms.
    - *Production*: Build sentences and fill blanks.
-   **Real-World Scenarios**:
    - Scenario A: First day at a new job (Formal).
    - Scenario B: Meeting someone at a language exchange (Informal).
    - Scenario C: Filling out a registration form at a gym/hotel.
-   **Professional Feedback**: Use explanations to provide cultural context or grammar tips (e.g., "In English, we use 'Mr.' with the surname, not the first name").

## Success Criteria
- The unit feels like a cohesive "journey" rather than a list of random questions.
- High variety of exercise types (Sentence building, Multiple choice, Fill-in-the-blank).
- Professional and natural language usage.
