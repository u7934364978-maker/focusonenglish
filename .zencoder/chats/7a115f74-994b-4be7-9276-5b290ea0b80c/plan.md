# Spec and build

## Agent Instructions

Ask the user questions when anything is unclear or needs their input. This includes:

- Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Technical decisions that affect architecture or user experience
- Trade-offs that require business context

Do not make assumptions on important decisions — get clarification first.

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Technical Specification

Assess the task's difficulty, as underestimating it leads to poor outcomes.

- easy: Straightforward implementation, trivial bug fix or feature
- medium: Moderate complexity, some edge cases or caveats to consider
- hard: Complex logic, many caveats, architectural considerations, or high-risk changes

Create a technical specification for the task that is appropriate for the complexity level.

### [x] Step: Implementation

Implement the task according to the technical specification and general engineering best practices.

1. [x] **Investigation**: Start dev server and check `/debug/a1-preview/unit-1` in browser.
2. [x] **Analysis**: Identified hydration errors (nested buttons, `new Date()` in SSR) and potential dynamic import issues.
3. [x] **Fix**: 
    - Fixed nested buttons in `ExerciseRenderer.tsx`.
    - Added hydration guard for date rendering.
    - Updated dynamic import to use relative path.
    - Added `aria-hidden` to Tooltips for better accessibility.
4. [x] **Verification**: Confirmed the fix in the browser via Playwright.
5. [x] **Test Plan Approval**: Obtained approval for E2E tests.
6. [x] **E2E Testing**: Wrote and ran Playwright tests in `e2e/unit-preview-fix.spec.ts`.
7. [x] **Report**: Wrote final report in `report.md`.
8. [ ] **Deployment**: Commit and push changes.
