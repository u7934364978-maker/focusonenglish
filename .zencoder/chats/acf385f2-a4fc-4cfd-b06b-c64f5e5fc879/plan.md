# Spec and build

## Agent Instructions

Ask the user questions when anything is unclear or needs their input. This includes:

- Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Technical decisions that affect architecture or user experience
- Trade-offs that require business context

Do not make assumptions on important decisions — get clarification first.

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Technical Specification

Assess the task's difficulty, as underestimating it leads to poor outcomes.

- **Complexity**: medium (Audit and fix of 200+ exercises across two files, ensuring syntax and logic correctness)

Created technical specification at `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/acf385f2-a4fc-4cfd-b06b-c64f5e5fc879/spec.md`.

### [ ] Step: Implementation

1. [ ] **Fix Unit 4 Exercises**: Correct syntax errors, types, and logic in `src/lib/course/b1/unit-4.ts`.
2. [ ] **Fix Unit 5 Exercises**: Correct syntax errors, types, and logic in `src/lib/course/b1/unit-5.ts`.
3. [ ] **Verify Build and Lint**: Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to ensure project integrity.
4. [ ] **Manual Verification**: Verify that a sample of exercises from Unit 4 and 5 display correctly in the preview page.
5. [ ] **Final Report**: Write completion report to `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/acf385f2-a4fc-4cfd-b06b-c64f5e5fc879/report.md`.
