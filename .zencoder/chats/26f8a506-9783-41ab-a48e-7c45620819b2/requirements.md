# PRD: B1 English Course Improvement

## Objective
Transform the existing "ingles-b1" course from a placeholder-based, repetitive structure into a comprehensive, high-quality course that meets official B1 (Intermediate) English level standards (CEFR).

## Current State Analysis
- The course has 30 units.
- Content is generated by a script that uses a very small set of pedagogical data.
- Most units contain repetitive exercises based on Unit 1 or Unit 2 data.
- 200 exercises per unit are mostly duplicates or variations of the same 4-8 examples.

## Requirements

### 1. Curriculum Definition
- A structured 30-unit curriculum must be defined.
- Each unit must focus on specific B1 grammar topics and vocabulary themes.
- Coverage should include:
    - **Grammar**: Present Perfect (Simple/Continuous), Past Continuous, Future (will/going to/present continuous), Modals (obligation, advice, possibility), Conditionals (0, 1, 2), Passive voice (present/past), Relative clauses, Reported speech, Comparatives/Superlatives.
    - **Vocabulary**: Work, Travel, Technology, Environment, Health, Media, Education, Society, Shopping, Food, History, Sports, Art, Science, Relationships, Finance, Crime, etc.

### 2. Content Quality and Variety
- Exercises should be varied in type: matching, transformation, true/false, reorder words, role play, multiple choice.
- Content must be pedagogically sound and accurate for B1 level.
- Avoid excessive repetition within a unit.

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Update the generation script or create a data-driven approach to populate the 30 units with unique content.
- Ensure the JSON files for each unit are correctly formatted for the existing frontend.

## Success Criteria
- Each of the 30 units has a distinct title and relevant B1 content.
- No unit contains placeholder or repetitive data from other units.
- The course follows a logical progression of difficulty and topics.
- Content is linguistically accurate.
