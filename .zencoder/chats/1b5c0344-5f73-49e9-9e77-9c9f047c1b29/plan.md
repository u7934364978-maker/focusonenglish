# Fix bug

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Investigation and Planning

Analyze the bug report and design a solution.

1. [x] Review the bug description, error messages, and logs: Done.
2. [x] Clarify reproduction steps with the user if unclear: Done (log provided).
3. [x] Check existing tests for clues about expected behavior: Not needed for build error.
4. [x] Locate relevant code sections and identify root cause: Identified issues in dynamic imports, auto-start logic, and dynamic rendering error handling.
5. [x] Propose a fix based on the investigation:
    - Fix incorrect import depth in dynamic imports.
    - Prevent exercise pre-generation during build.
    - Handle dynamic rendering error in `MisionesPage` gracefully.
6. [x] Consider edge cases and potential side effects: None significant.

### [x] Step: Implementation

1. [x] Implement the fix in `src/app/curso-a2/[unitId]/page.tsx`:
    - Fix dynamic import paths and added warning for fallback.
2. [x] Implement the fix in `src/lib/ai/exercise-pre-generator.ts`:
    - Added comprehensive build check (`CI`, `VERCEL`, `NEXT_PHASE`) to prevent auto-start.
3. [x] Implement the fix in `src/app/misiones/page.tsx`:
    - Silenced `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` error during build.
4. [x] Run a local build to verify fixes: Success.

### [x] Step: Resolve Vercel Deployment Internal Error (Persistent)

Investigate and fix the persistent "Internal Error" occurring during "Deploying outputs".

1. [x] Analyze `next.config.js` for optimization opportunities: Reverted `standalone` and removed redundant configs.
2. [x] Check for multiple lockfiles: Confirmed existence and handled.
3. [x] Analyze project root and `vercel.json` for conflicts: Simplified `vercel.json`.
4. [x] Check for large files or directories that might exceed deployment limits: Verified `public/` and `.gitignore`.
5. [x] Implement fixes (e.g., simplifying `vercel.json`, refining `.gitignore`): Done.
6. [ ] Push and verify.
