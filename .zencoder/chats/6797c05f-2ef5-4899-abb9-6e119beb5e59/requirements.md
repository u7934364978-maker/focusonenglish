# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Blog 404 Error Detection

## 1. Introduction
The objective is to identify and list all 404 errors (broken links) across the entire Focus English blog. As an SEO expert, maintaining a clean link profile is crucial for domain authority and user experience.

## 2. Goals
- Identify all internal broken links within the blog articles and hubs.
- Identify all external broken links within the blog articles and hubs.
- Provide a clear report of these errors to facilitate fixing them.

## 3. Scope
- **Internal Links**: Links pointing to other pages within `www.focus-on-english.com`.
- **External Links**: Links pointing to external domains.
- **Content Sources**:
  - `src/content/blog/**/*.md`
  - `src/content/hubs/**/*.md`
  - Pages defined in `sitemap.ts` (as reference for valid internal URLs).

## 4. Functional Requirements
- **URL Extraction**: The system must be able to extract all URLs from Markdown content and relevant React components (if possible).
- **Broken Link Verification**:
  - For **internal links**, verify against the list of valid routes generated by the application.
  - For **external links**, perform HTTP HEAD/GET requests to check for 404 status codes.
- **Reporting**: Generate a report listing:
  - Source file/page where the broken link was found.
  - The broken URL.
  - Link type (Internal/External).
  - Status code or reason for failure.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The script should be efficient enough to run periodically.
- **Reliability**: Accurately distinguish between transient network errors and actual 404s.

## 6. Constraints
- Use existing project dependencies where possible.
- Avoid impacting the production site's performance during scanning.

## 7. Assumptions
- The `sitemap.ts` logic correctly represents the current valid public URLs.
- The environment has internet access to check external links.
