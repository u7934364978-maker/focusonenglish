# PRD - A1 Course Expansion with New Educational Content

## Problem Statement
The current A1 English course needs more practice material for core topics like adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and common mistakes. New instructional content has been provided to expand the existing exercise pool and improve student learning outcomes.

## Goals
1. Integrate the provided educational content into the A1 course structure.
2. Create varied exercises (multiple choice, sentence building, fill-in-the-blanks) based on the new content.
3. Address common Spanish-speaker mistakes highlighted in the source text.
4. Ensure students can practice:
   - Adjectives (position and singular form)
   - Adverbs (formation with -ly and frequency adverbs)
   - Connectors (After vs Then vs Afterwards)
   - Possession (Genitive Saxon vs 'Of')
   - Transports and their specific prepositions (by car, on the bus, in my car)
   - Dates and Ordinals
   - Prepositions of Place

## Target Audience
- A1 level Spanish speakers learning English.

## Content Breakdown & Mapping
- **Adjectives**: Integrated into Module 2 (Descriptions).
- **Adverbs & Frequency**: Integrated into Module 3 (Daily Routines).
- **After/Then/Afterwards**: Integrated into Module 3 (Routines).
- **Common Mistakes (A/An, Plurals, etc.)**: Integrated into Module 1 and 2 reviews.
- **Genitive Saxon**: Integrated into Module 2 Lesson 3.
- **Capital Letters**: Integrated into Module 3 Lesson 2 (Dates).
- **Ordinals & Dates**: Integrated into Module 3 Lesson 2.
- **Transports & Prepositions**: Integrated into Module 5 (City & Transport).
- **Prepositions of Place**: Integrated into Module 5 (City).

## Functional Requirements
- **Exercise Variety**: Use at least 3 different exercise types:
  - `multiple-choice`: For grammar selection.
  - `fill-blank`: For preposition and conjugation practice.
  - `sentence-building`: For adjective-noun order and frequency adverb position.
- **Explanations**: Each exercise must include a Spanish explanation explaining *why* an answer is correct, referencing the rules in the source text.
- **Keys**: All exercises must have correct answers and point values.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Consistency**: Maintain the same coding patterns and data structures as existing `*-detailed.ts` files.
- **Maintainability**: Centralize the expansion content to avoid cluttering existing files before final integration.
