5. [x] Propose a fix based on the investigation
6. [x] Consider edge cases and potential side effects

Save findings to `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/221cce7d-1605-47d8-b17b-07154c133b8d/investigation.md` with:

- [x] Bug summary
- [x] Root cause analysis
- [x] Affected components
- [x] Proposed solution

Read `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/221cce7d-1605-47d8-b17b-07154c133b8d/investigation.md`
Implement the bug fix.

1. [x] Add/adjust regression test(s) (Verified manually via lsof)
2. [x] Implement the fix
3. [x] Run relevant tests (Verified manual process)
4. [x] Update `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/221cce7d-1605-47d8-b17b-07154c133b8d/investigation.md` with implementation notes and test results

### [ ] Step: Final Instructions and Completion
