# PRD: SEO Content Expansion

## Overview
The goal is to expand existing blog articles in the Focus English platform to at least 750 words each. This is intended to improve SEO rankings by providing high-quality, comprehensive content for specialized English learning (Work, Travel, and Exams).

## Target Content
- **Location**: `src/content/blog/**/*.md`
- **Scope**: All articles under `examenes/`, `metodos/`, `seo/`, `trabajo/`, and `viajes/`.

## Requirements
1. **Word Count**: Each article must be expanded to a minimum of 750 words.
2. **Quality**: Content must be high-quality, relevant to the topic, and follow SEO best practices (keywords, headings, readability).
3. **Consistency**: Maintain the existing tone and style of the blog.
4. **Format**: Preserve the Markdown structure and frontmatter.
5. **Language**: Articles are in Spanish (as indicated by filenames and initial inspection).

## Unclear Aspects & Assumptions
- **Order of expansion**: I will proceed folder by folder, starting with `seo/` as it seems most relevant for the goal.
- **Specific Keywords**: I will infer keywords from the existing title and content.
- **Tools**: I will use my internal writing capabilities to expand the content while maintaining factual accuracy about English learning.

## Success Criteria
- All articles in the specified directories have >= 750 words.
- Markdown frontmatter is preserved.
- Content remains logically structured with appropriate headings.
