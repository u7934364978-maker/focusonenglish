### 4. **Potential Gaps & Limitations**

While the course is comprehensive, note these minor gaps:

| Gap | Severity | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| **Listening/Speaking Practice** | Medium | Course emphasizes reading/grammar. Audio references exist, but interactive conversation simulation is limited. |
| **Written Production** | Low | Writing tasks are scaffolded (fill-blank, ordering). Few free-writing exercises. |
| **Cultural Content** | Low | Course lacks cultural references (customs, traditions, daily life in English-speaking countries). |
| **Formal vs. Informal Register** | Low | Limited exploration of register differences (when to use "Hi" vs. "Hello" is mentioned, but not deeply explored). |
| **Conversational Idioms** | Low | No phrasal verbs, idioms, or colloquial expressions (appropriate for A1, but worth noting). |

**Recommendation**: Consider supplementing with:
- Listening exercises (podcasts, videos)
- Peer conversation practice
- Writing journals or free composition tasks
