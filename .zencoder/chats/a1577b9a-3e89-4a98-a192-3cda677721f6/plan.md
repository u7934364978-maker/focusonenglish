## Tasks
### [x] Step: Screen-by-Screen Exercise Rendering
1.  **Implement question pagination**: Modify `ExerciseRenderer.tsx` to show one question at a time when an exercise contains multiple questions. [x]
2.  **Add navigation controls**: Add "Next" button functionality within the set of questions and only trigger `onComplete` when the final question is answered. [x]
3.  **Verify layout and spacing**: Ensure each question has enough space for responses and is correctly formulated. [x]
4.  **Push and commit**: Commit the changes and provide the commit hash. [x]
