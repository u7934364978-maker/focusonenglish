# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Educational Content Improvements for Banking and Finance Course

## 1. Overview
The goal is to enhance the existing "Banca y Finanzas" (Banking and Finance) course content to make it more engaging, practical, and aligned with modern industry trends. The current content is structured with theory and exercises (mostly multiple choice and reading comprehension).

## 2. Objectives
- Improve student engagement through interactive and practical content.
- Update the curriculum with modern financial topics.
- Develop soft skills specific to the financial sector.
- Enhance the variety of exercise types beyond multiple choice.

## 3. Proposed Improvements

### 3.1. Content Modernization
- **Modern Topics**: Add lessons or sections on:
  - **Fintech**: Digital banking, payment gateways, and blockchain basics.
  - **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)**: Sustainable finance and ethical investing.
  - **AI in Finance**: How automation and algorithms are changing the industry.
  - **Cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**.

### 3.2. Practical Application and Case Studies
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Replace generic texts with actual or simulated case studies (e.g., "The 2008 Financial Crisis", "The Rise of Neo-banks").
- **Problem-Solving Exercises**: Exercises where students must make a decision based on financial data (e.g., "Recommend a hedging strategy based on this market forecast").

### 3.3. Soft Skills and Communication
- **Financial English for Professionals**:
  - **Negotiation**: Phrases and strategies for deal-making.

- **Writing Tasks**: Drafting formal emails, executive summaries, or investment memos.
- **Audio/Visual Integration**: Incorporate listening exercises based on financial news or podcasts (transcripts and comprehension questions).

### 3.5. Visual and Structural Improvements
- **Process Diagrams**: Use text-based diagrams (Mermaid or similar) to explain complex flows like the IPO process or M&A stages.
- **Glossary Expansion**: Enhance the current `glossary.json` with more contextual examples and pronunciation guides.

## 4. Success Criteria
- Increased variety in `exercises.json` across all levels.
- Inclusion of modern topics in `theory.json`.
- Positive feedback on the practical relevance of the content.
