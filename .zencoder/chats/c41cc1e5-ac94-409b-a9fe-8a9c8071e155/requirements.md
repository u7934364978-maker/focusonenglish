# Product Requirements Document: English A1 Course Structure (60 Units)

## Overview
The goal is to design a professional, digital-first English course for beginners (CEFR Level A1) consisting of 60 units. Each unit must include 60 high-quality exercises, moving beyond trivial multiple-choice questions to incorporate proven pedagogical techniques.

## Learning Objectives (A1 CEFR)
- Understand and use familiar everyday expressions and basic phrases.
- Introduce oneself and others and ask/answer questions about personal details.
- Interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly.

## Pedagogical Framework
- **Scaffolding**: Each unit builds on previous knowledge, gradually increasing complexity.
- **Active Recall & Spaced Repetition**: Exercises designed to pull information from memory rather than just recognizing it.
- **Contextual Learning**: Vocabulary and grammar are taught within situational contexts (e.g., at a restaurant, booking a hotel).
- **Gamification Elements**: Exercise design will support progress tracking and immediate feedback.
- **Micro-learning**: Breaking down 60 exercises into small, digestible chunks within each unit to maintain engagement.

## Course Structure (High-Level)
- **60 Units**: Divided into 6 thematic modules (10 units per module).
  - Module 1: Foundations & Personal Info (Units 1-10)
  - Module 2: Daily Life & Routine (Units 11-20)
  - Module 3: Social Interactions & Leisure (Units 21-30)
  - Module 4: Travel & Shopping (Units 31-40)
  - Module 5: Health & Environment (Units 41-50)
  - Module 6: Work & Future Plans (Units 51-60)

## Exercise Structure (60 per Unit)
To avoid triviality, exercises will follow a structured progression:
1. **Warm-up (5)**: Visual/Audio recognition (Building mental models).
2. **Concept Acquisition (10)**: Meaning-to-form matching, guided discovery.
3. **Controlled Practice (15)**: Gap-fills with constraints, sentence unscrambling.
4. **Active Production (15)**: Guided translation, audio-to-text transcription.
5. **Communicative Application (10)**: Dialogue completion, situational response.
6. **Review & Mastery (5)**: Error correction, fast-recall challenges.

## Key Features
- **Professionalism**: Content focuses on real-world utility.
- **Digital Optimized**: Interactive formats (drag & drop, voice-to-text ready, etc.).
- **Exhaustive**: Covers all A1 grammar and vocabulary requirements.
