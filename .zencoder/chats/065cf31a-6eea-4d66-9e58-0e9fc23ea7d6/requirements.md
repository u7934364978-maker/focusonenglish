# PRD: A1 Course Standardization - Module 2 (Phase 1)

## Context
The A1 English course is undergoing a quality standardization process based on the `course-specifications.md` guide created on Feb 15. Module 1 is complete. Some units in Module 2 (17, 19, 20) are also complete. The remaining units in Module 2 need to be refactored to meet high pedagogical and technical standards.

## Goals
Standardize the following units in Module 2:
1.  **Unit 11**: Telling the Time
2.  **Unit 12**: Days of the Week
3.  **Unit 13**: Daily Routine

## Quality Standards (per `course-specifications.md`)
1.  **Total Exercises**: Exactly 60 exercises per unit.
2.  **Bilingual Format**: ALL English text (transcripts, questions, options, etc.) must use `[[English|Spanish]]`.
3.  **Non-Triviality**: Exercises must require comprehension, not just pattern matching or obvious guesses.
4.  **Two-Phase Reading**: Reading exercises must utilize the `transcript` field for the text and separate `questions`. No text repetition in the question field.
5.  **Randomized Answers**: Correct answers distributed across A, B, and C.
6.  **Progressive Difficulty**: Flow from flashcards -> multiple choice -> sentence building.
7.  **"Son" Warning**: Avoid flagging "son" (Spanish) when it refers to "son" (English).

## Requirements per Unit (from `course-specifications.md`)

### Unit 11: Telling the Time
- **Vocabulary**: Time expressions (O'clock, Half past, Quarter to/past), Parts of the day.
- **Grammar**: What time is it?, Prepositions of time (At).
- **Reading**: Daily schedules and appointment bookings.

### Unit 12: Days of the Week
- **Vocabulary**: Days of the week, Weekend vs. Weekdays.
- **Grammar**: Prepositions of time (On), Present Simple for habitual actions.
- **Reading**: Weekly planners and diaries.

### Unit 13: Daily Routine
- **Vocabulary**: Routine verbs (Wake up, Brush teeth, Have breakfast, Go to bed).
- **Grammar**: Sequence adverbs (First, Then, After that), Present Simple consistency.
- **Reading**: "A Day in the Life" - Narrative texts about different routines.

## Verification Plan
- Unit test to ensure each file has 60 exercises.
- Visual inspection via browser for the two-phase reading UI.
- Manual audit of a sample of exercises for bilingual format and pedagogical quality.
