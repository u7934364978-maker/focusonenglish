# Generation Plan: 300 Unique A1 Unit 1 Exercises

## Phase 1: Setup & Prototypes
- [x] Create generation script with Scenario Matrix logic
- [x] Test prototype for all exercise types (word-search, crossword, multiple-choice, fill-blank, sentence-building)
- [x] Fix "matching" type incompatibility (mapping to multiple-choice)

## Phase 2: Batch Generation
- [x] Batch 1 (0-60): Basic vocabulary and greetings (Completed)
- [x] Batch 2 (61-120): Classroom English and Numbers (Completed)
- [x] Batch 3 (121-140): Mix of topics (Completed - Interrupted by API Quota)
- [ ] Batch 4 (141-200): Advanced variations (Pending Quota Reset)
- [ ] Batch 5 (201-300): Roleplay and Contextual scenarios (Pending Quota Reset)

## Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Verify uniqueness via content hashing
- [ ] Check schema compliance for all 300 exercises
- [ ] Export final file to `src/lib/generated-a1-unit1-exercises.ts`

**Note**: Current progress is **140/300** exercises. Blocked by OpenAI `insufficient_quota`.
