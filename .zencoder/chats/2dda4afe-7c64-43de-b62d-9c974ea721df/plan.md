# Spec and build

## Agent Instructions

Ask the user questions when anything is unclear or needs their input. This includes:

- Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Technical decisions that affect architecture or user experience
- Trade-offs that require business context

Do not make assumptions on important decisions — get clarification first.

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Technical Specification

Assess the task's difficulty, as underestimating it leads to poor outcomes.

- easy: Straightforward implementation, trivial bug fix or feature
- medium: Moderate complexity, some edge cases or caveats to consider
- hard: Complex logic, many caveats, architectural considerations, or high-risk changes

Create a technical specification for the task that is appropriate for the complexity level:

- Review the existing codebase architecture and identify reusable components.
- Define the implementation approach based on established patterns in the project.
- Identify all source code files that will be created or modified.
- Define any necessary data model, API, or interface changes.
- Describe verification steps using the project's test and lint commands.

Save the output to `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/2dda4afe-7c64-43de-b62d-9c974ea721df/spec.md` with:

- Technical context (language, dependencies)
- Implementation approach
- Source code structure changes
- Data model / API / interface changes
- Verification approach

If the task is complex enough, create a detailed implementation plan based on `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/2dda4afe-7c64-43de-b62d-9c974ea721df/spec.md`:

- Break down the work into concrete tasks (incrementable, testable milestones)
- Each task should reference relevant contracts and include verification steps
- Replace the Implementation step below with the planned tasks

Rule of thumb for step size: each step should represent a coherent unit of work (e.g., implement a component, add an API endpoint, write tests for a module). Avoid steps that are too granular (single function).

Save to `/Users/lidia/Documents/focusonenglish/focusonenglish/.zencoder/chats/2dda4afe-7c64-43de-b62d-9c974ea721df/plan.md`. If the feature is trivial and doesn't warrant this breakdown, keep the Implementation step below as is.

### [✅] Step: Refactor Vocabulary Exercises - Add Contextual Clues (Units 1-4)

**Issue**: Vocabulary multiple-choice exercises lack sufficient context in question stems, making alternative options appear equally valid.

**Solution Approach**:
1. ✅ Analyze all vocabulary exercises in Units 1-4 
   - Unit 1: 0 vocabulary exercises (all grammar-based)
   - Unit 2: 10 vocabulary exercises (grammar-based question words - already have adequate context)
   - Unit 3: 7 vocabulary exercises (family relations - contextual clues embedded in question)
   - Unit 4: 16 vocabulary exercises (physical descriptions - **REFACTORED**)

2. ✅ **Unit 4 Fixes** - Added contextual clues to 16 exercises:
   - e7: Added "young girl with soft, youthful features" → round face
   - e9: Added "boy who is self-conscious about prominent ears" → big ears
   - e11: Added "girl from Scandinavia with fair skin" → blonde hair
   - e13: Added "basketball player who reaches high objects" → tall body
   - e31: Added "model who stands out in crowds" → tall and slim
   - e33: Added "bearded man with Mediterranean heritage" → brown eyes
   - e35: Added "formal evening gala" context → red dress
   - e39: Added "ballet dancer with graceful posture" → slim waist
   - e43: Added "fair-skinned girl with red hair" → freckles
   - e45: Added "distinctive, striking" adjective → long red hair
   - e48: Added "star soccer player" → tall and athletic
   - e50: Added "businessman at formal board meeting" → dressed smartly
   - e52: Added "weightlifter who trains 6 hours daily" → muscular build
   - e54: Added "professional news broadcaster" → clear voice

3. ✅ Verified all units - Units 1-3 have adequate context already or are grammar-based

**Commits**: 
- c4204024: Refactor Unit 4 vocabulary exercises - add contextual clues to question stems for clarity

**Status**: ✅ Completed
